and discretion

15 A wise man will hear and will increase learning and a man of
understanding shall attain unto wise counsels 16 To understand a
proverb and the interpretation the words of the wise and their dark
sayings

17 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge but fools
despise wisdom and instruction

18 My son hear the instruction of thy father and forsake not the
law of thy mother 19 For they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy
head and chains about thy neck

110 My son if sinners entice thee consent thou not

111 If they say Come with us let us lay wait for blood let us lurk
privily for the innocent without cause 112 Let us swallow them up
alive as the grave and whole as those that go down into the pit
113 We shall find all precious substance we shall fill our houses
with spoil 114 Cast in thy lot among us let us all have one purse
115 My son walk not thou in the way with them refrain thy foot from
their path 116 For their feet run to evil and make haste to shed
blood

117 Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird

118 And they lay wait for their own blood they lurk privily for
their own lives

119 So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain which taketh
away the life of the owners thereof

120 Wisdom crieth without she uttereth her voice in the streets
121 She crieth in the chief place of concourse in the openings of
the gates in the city she uttereth her words saying 122 How long
ye simple ones will ye love simplicity and the scorners delight in
their scorning and fools hate knowledge  123 Turn you at my
reproof behold I will pour out my spirit unto you I will make known
my words unto you

124 Because I have called and ye refused I have stretched out my
hand and no man regarded 125 But ye have set at nought all my
counsel and would none of my reproof 126 I also will laugh at your
calamity I will mock when your fear cometh 127 When your fear
cometh as desolation and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind when
distress and anguish cometh upon you

128 Then shall they call upon me but I will not answer they shall
seek me early but they shall not find me 129 For that they hated
knowledge and did not choose the fear of the LORD 130 They would
none of my counsel they despised all my reproof

131 Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way and be
filled with their own devices

132 For the turning away of the simple shall slay them and the
prosperity of fools shall destroy them

133 But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely and shall be
quiet from fear of evil

21 My son if thou wilt receive my words and hide my commandments
with thee 22 So that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom and apply
thine heart to understanding 23 Yea if thou criest after knowledge
and liftest up thy voice for understanding 24 If thou seekest her as
silver and searchest for her as for hid treasures 25 Then shalt
thou understand the fear of the LORD and find the knowledge of God

26 For the LORD giveth wisdom out of his mouth cometh knowledge and
understanding

27 He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous he is a buckler to
them that walk uprightly

28 He keepeth the paths of judgment and preserveth the way of his
saints

29 Then shalt thou understand righteousness and judgment and
equity yea every good path

210 When wisdom entereth into thine heart and knowledge is pleasant
unto thy soul 211 Discretion shall preserve thee understanding
shall keep thee 212 To deliver thee from the way of the evil man
from the man that speaketh froward things 213 Who leave the paths of
uprightness to walk in the ways of darkness 214 Who rejoice to do
evil and delight in the frowardness of the wicked 215 Whose ways
are crooked and they froward in their paths 216 To deliver thee
from the strange woman even from the stranger which flattereth with
her words 217 Which forsaketh the guide of her youth and forgetteth
the covenant of her God

218 For her house inclineth unto death and her paths unto the dead

219 None that go unto her return again neither take they hold of the
paths of life

220 That thou mayest walk in the way of good men and keep the paths
of the righteous
