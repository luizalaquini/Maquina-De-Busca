the service thereof and for all that shall be done therein

4415 But the priests the Levites the sons of Zadok that kept the
charge of my sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from
me they shall come near to me to minister unto me and they shall
stand before me to offer unto me the fat and the blood saith the Lord
GOD 4416 They shall enter into my sanctuary and they shall come
near to my table to minister unto me and they shall keep my charge

4417 And it shall come to pass that when they enter in at the gates
of the inner court they shall be clothed with linen garments and no
wool shall come upon them whiles they minister in the gates of the
inner court and within

4418 They shall have linen bonnets upon their heads and shall have
linen breeches upon their loins they shall not gird themselves with
any thing that causeth sweat

4419 And when they go forth into the utter court even into the utter
court to the people they shall put off their garments wherein they
ministered and lay them in the holy chambers and they shall put on
other garments and they shall not sanctify the people with their
garments

4420 Neither shall they shave their heads nor suffer their locks to
grow long they shall only poll their heads

4421 Neither shall any priest drink wine when they enter into the
inner court

4422 Neither shall they take for their wives a widow nor her that is
put away but they shall take maidens of the seed of the house of
Israel or a widow that had a priest before

4423 And they shall teach my people the difference between the holy
and profane and cause them to discern between the unclean and the
clean

4424 And in controversy they shall stand in judgment and they shall
judge it according to my judgments and they shall keep my laws and my
statutes in all mine assemblies and they shall hallow my sabbaths

4425 And they shall come at no dead person to defile themselves but
for father or for mother or for son or for daughter for brother
or for sister that hath had no husband they may defile themselves

4426 And after he is cleansed they shall reckon unto him seven days

4427 And in the day that he goeth into the sanctuary unto the inner
court to minister in the sanctuary he shall offer his sin offering
saith the Lord GOD

4428 And it shall be unto them for an inheritance I am their
inheritance and ye shall give them no possession in Israel I am
their possession

4429 They shall eat the meat offering and the sin offering and the
trespass offering and every dedicated thing in Israel shall be
theirs

4430 And the first of all the firstfruits of all things and every
oblation of all of every sort of your oblations shall be the
priests ye shall also give unto the priest the first of your dough
that he may cause the blessing to rest in thine house

4431 The priests shall not eat of any thing that is dead of itself
or torn whether it be fowl or beast

451 Moreover when ye shall divide by lot the land for inheritance
ye shall offer an oblation unto the LORD an holy portion of the land
the length shall be the length of five and twenty thousand reeds and
the breadth shall be ten thousand This shall be holy in all the
borders thereof round about

452 Of this there shall be for the sanctuary five hundred in length
with five hundred in breadth square round about and fifty cubits
round about for the suburbs thereof

453 And of this measure shalt thou measure the length of five and
twenty thousand and the breadth of ten thousand and in it shall be
the sanctuary and the most holy place

454 The holy portion of the land shall be for the priests the
ministers of the sanctuary which shall come near to minister unto the
LORD and it shall be a place for their houses and an holy place for
the sanctuary

455 And the five and twenty thousand of length and the ten thousand
of breadth shall also the Levites the ministers of the house have
for themselves for a possession for twenty chambers

456 And ye shall appoint the possession of the city five thousand
broad and five and twenty thousand long over against the oblation of
the holy portion it shall be for the whole house of Israel

457 And a portion shall be for the prince on the one side and on the
other side of the oblation of the holy portion and of the possession
of the city before the oblation of the holy portion and before the
possession of the city from the west side westward and from the east
side eastward and the length shall be over against one of the
