Someone could make a rare fine song of that Tom plucked a string on his woodharp

Lady Smallwood gave him a withering look Someone who doesn’t rhyme carry on with Dondarrion perhaps Or play ‘Oh Lay My Sweet Lass Down in the Grass’ to every milkmaid in the shire and leave two of them with big bellies

It was ‘Let Me Drink Your Beauty’ said Tom defensively and milkmaids are always glad to hear it As was a certain highborn lady I do recall I play to please

Her nostrils flared The riverlands are full of maids you’ve pleased all drinking tansy tea You’d think a man as old as you would know to spill his seed on their bellies Men will be calling you Tom Sevensons before much longer

As it happens said Tom I passed seven many years ago And fine boys they are too with voices sweet as nightingales Plainly he did not care for the subject

Did his lordship say where he was bound milady asked Harwin

Lord Beric never shares his plans but there’s hunger down near Stoney Sept and the Threepenny Wood I should look for him there She took a sip of wine You’d best know I’ve had less pleasant callers as well A pack of wolves came howling around my gates thinking I might have Jaime Lannister in here

Tom stopped his plucking Then it’s true the Kingslayer is loose again

Lady Smallwood gave him a scornful look I hardly think they’d be hunting him if he was chained up under Riverrun

What did m’lady tell them asked Jack-Be-Lucky

Why that I had Ser Jaime naked in my bed but I’d left him much too exhausted to come down One of them had the effrontery to call me a liar so we saw them off with a few quarrels I believe they made for Blackbottom Bend

Arya squirmed restlessly in her seat What northmen was it who came looking after the Kingslayer

Lady Smallwood seemed surprised that she’d spoken They did not give their names child but they wore black with the badge of a white sun on the breast

A white sun on black was the sigil of Lord Karstark Arya thought Those were Robb’s men She wondered if they were still close If she could give the outlaws the slip and find them maybe they would take her to her mother at Riverrun…

Did they say how Lannister came to escape Lem asked

They did said Lady Smallwood Not that I believe a word of it They claimed that Lady Catelyn set him free

That startled Tom so badly he snapped a string Go on with you he said That’s madness

It’s not true thought Arya It couldn’t be true

I thought the same said Lady Smallwood

That was when Harwin remembered Arya Such talk is not for your ears milady

No I want to hear

The outlaws were adamant Go on with you skinny squirrel said Greenbeard Be a good little lady and go play in the yard while we talk now

Arya stalked away angry and would have slammed the door if it hadn’t been so heavy Darkness had settled over Acorn Hall A few torches burned along the walls but that was all The gates of the little castle were closed and barred She had promised Harwin that she would not try and run away again she knew but that was before they started telling lies about her mother

Arya Gendry had followed her out Lady Smallwood said there’s a smithy Want to have a look

If you want She had nothing else to do

This Thoros Gendry said as they walked past the kennels is he the same Thoros who lived in the castle at King’s Landing A red priest fat with a shaved head

I think so Arya had never spoken to Thoros at King’s Landing that she could recall but she knew who he was He and Jalabhar Xho had been the most colorful figures at Robert’s court and Thoros was a great friend of the king as well
