No -- that is -- I certainly have heard Liddy say
they do but --  --  She paused
Capitulation -- that was the purport of the simple
reply guarded as it was -- capitulation unknown to her+
self Never did a fragile tailless sentence convey a
more perfect meaning The careless sergeant smiled
within himself and probably too the devil smiled from
a loop-hole in Tophet for the moment was the turning+
point of a career Her tone and mien signified beyond
mistake that the seed which was to lift the foundation
had taken root in the chink  the remainder was a mere
question of time and natural changes
There the truth comes out   said the soldier in
reply Never tell me that a young lady can live in a
buzz of admiration without knowing something about it
Ah well Miss Everdene you are -- pardon my blunt
way -- you are rather an injury to our race than other+
wise
 How -- indeed   she said opening her eyes
O it is true enough I may as well be hung for
a sheep as a lamb an old country saying not of much
account but it will do for a rough soldier and so I
will speak my mind regardless of your pleasure and
without hoping or intending to get your pardon Why
Miss Everdene it is in this manner that your good
looks may do more harm than good in the world
The sergeant looked down the mead in critical abstrac+
ion  Probably some one man on an average falls in
love with each ordinary woman She can marry him 
he is content and leads a useful life Such women as
you a hundred men always covet -- your eyes will be+
witch scores on scores into an unavailing fancy for you
you can only marry one of that many Out of these
say twenty will endeavour to drown the bitterness of
espised love in drink  twenty more will mope away
their lives without a wish or attempt to make a mark in

their attachment to you  twenty more -- the susceptible

draggling after you getting where they may just see
you doing desperate things Men are such constant
fools The rest may try to get over their passion with
more or less success But all these men will be
saddened And not only those ninety-nine men but
the ninety-nine women they might have married are
saddened with them Theres my tale Thats why I
say that a woman so charming as yourself Miss Ever+
dene is hardly a blessing to her race
The handsome sergeants features were during this
speech as rigid and stern as John Knoxs in addressing
his gay young queen
Seeing she made no reply he said Do you read
French  
No I began but when I got to the verbs father
died she said simply
I do -- -when I have an opportunity which latterly
has not been often my mother was a Parisienne -- -and
theres a proverb they have Qui aime bien chatie bien
 -- He chastens who loves well Do you understand
me
Ah she replied and there was even a little tremu+
lousness in the usually cool girls voice if you can
only fight half as winningly as you can talk you are
able to make a pleasure of a bayonet wound And
then poor Bathsheba instanly perceived her slip in
making this admission in hastily trying to retrieve it
she went from bad to worse Dont however suppose
that I derive any pleasure from what you tell me
I know you do not -- -I know it perfectly said Troy
with much hearty conviction on the exterior of his face
and altering the expression to moodiness when a
dozen men arfe ready to speak tenderly to you and
give the admiration you deserve without adding the
warning you need it stands to reason that my poor
rough-and-ready mixture of praise and blame cannot

because its vigour was overwelming
I would not own it to anybody esle -- nor do I

conceit in my foolish supposition the other night I
knew that what I said in admiration might be an
opinion too often forced upon you to give any pleasure
but I certainly did think that the kindness of your
