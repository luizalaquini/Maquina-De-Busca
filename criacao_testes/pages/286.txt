Please Sansa said I only meant… it would be ill luck Your Grace… to to kill a man on your name day

You’re lying Joffrey said I ought to drown you with him if you care for him so much

I don’t care for him Your Grace The words tumbled out desperately Drown him or have his head off only… kill him on the morrow if you like but please… not today not on your name day I couldn’t bear for you to have ill luck… terrible luck even for kings the singers all say so…

Joffrey scowled He knew she was lying she could see it He would make her bleed for this

The girl speaks truly the Hound rasped What a man sows on his name day he reaps throughout the year His voice was flat as if he did not care a whit whether the king believed him or no Could it be true Sansa had not known It was just something she’d said desperate to avoid punishment

Unhappy Joffrey shifted in his seat and flicked his fingers at Ser Dontos Take him away I’ll have him killed on the morrow the fool

He is Sansa said A fool You’re so clever to see it He’s better fitted to be a fool than a knight isn’t he You ought to dress him in motley and make him clown for you He doesn’t deserve the mercy of a quick death

The king studied her a moment Perhaps you’re not so stupid as Mother says He raised his voice Did you hear my lady Dontos From this day on you’re my new fool You can sleep with Moon Boy and dress in motley

Ser Dontos sobered by his near brush with death crawled to his knees Thank you Your Grace And you my lady Thank you

As a brace of Lannister guardsmen led him off the master of revels approached the box Your Grace he said shall I summon a new challenger for Brune or proceed with the next tilt

Neither These are gnats not knights I’d have them all put to death only it’s my name day The tourney is done Get them all out of my sight

The master of revels bowed but Prince Tommen was not so obedient I’m supposed to ride against the straw man

Not today

But I want to ride

I don’t care what you want

Mother said I could ride

She said Princess Myrcella agreed

Mother said mocked the king Don’t be childish

We’re children Myrcella declared haughtily We’re supposed to be childish

The Hound laughed She has you there

Joffrey was beaten Very well Even my brother couldn’t tilt any worse than these others Master bring out the quintain Tommen wants to be a gnat

Tommen gave a shout of joy and ran off to be readied his chubby little legs pumping hard Luck Sansa called to him

They set up the quintain at the far end of the lists while the prince’s pony was being saddled Tommen’s opponent was a child-sized leather warrior stuffed with straw and mounted on a pivot with a shield in one hand and a padded mace in the other Someone had fastened a pair of antlers to the knight’s head Joffrey’s father King Robert had worn antlers on his helm Sansa remembered… but so did his uncle Lord Renly Robert’s brother who had turned traitor and crowned himself king

A pair of squires buckled the prince into his ornate silver-and-crimson armor A tall plume of red feathers sprouted from the crest of his helm and the lion of Lannister and crowned stag of Baratheon frolicked together on his shield The squires helped him mount and Ser Aron Santagar the Red Keep’s master-at-arms stepped forward and handed Tommen a blunted silver longsword with a leaf-shaped blade crafted to fit an eight-year-old hand

Tommen raised the blade high Casterly Rock he shouted in a high boyish voice as he put his heels into his pony and started across the hard-packed dirt at the quintain Lady Tanda and Lord Gyles started a ragged cheer and Sansa added her voice to theirs The king brooded in silence

Tommen got his pony up to a brisk trot waved his sword vigorously and struck the knight’s shield a solid blow as he went by The quintain spun the padded mace flying around to give the prince a mighty whack in the back of his head Tommen spilled from the saddle his new armor rattling like a bag of old pots as he hit the ground His sword went flying his pony cantered away across the bailey and a great gale of derision went up King Joffrey laughed longest and loudest of all

Oh Princess Myrcella cried She scrambled out of the box and ran to her little brother
