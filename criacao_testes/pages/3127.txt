119 So the king of the south shall come into his kingdom and shall
return into his own land

1110 But his sons shall be stirred up and shall assemble a multitude
of great forces and one shall certainly come and overflow and pass
through then shall he return and be stirred up even to his
fortress

1111 And the king of the south shall be moved with choler and shall
come forth and fight with him even with the king of the north and he
shall set forth a great multitude but the multitude shall be given
into his hand

1112 And when he hath taken away the multitude his heart shall be
lifted up and he shall cast down many ten thousands but he shall not
be strengthened by it

1113 For the king of the north shall return and shall set forth a
multitude greater than the former and shall certainly come after
certain years with a great army and with much riches

1114 And in those times there shall many stand up against the king of
the south also the robbers of thy people shall exalt themselves to
establish the vision but they shall fall

1115 So the king of the north shall come and cast up a mount and
take the most fenced cities and the arms of the south shall not
withstand neither his chosen people neither shall there be any
strength to withstand

1116 But he that cometh against him shall do according to his own
will and none shall stand before him and he shall stand in the
glorious land which by his hand shall be consumed

1117 He shall also set his face to enter with the strength of his
whole kingdom and upright ones with him thus shall he do and he
shall give him the daughter of women corrupting her but she shall
not stand on his side neither be for him

1118 After this shall he turn his face unto the isles and shall take
many but a prince for his own behalf shall cause the reproach offered
by him to cease without his own reproach he shall cause it to turn
upon him

1119 Then he shall turn his face toward the fort of his own land but
he shall stumble and fall and not be found

1120 Then shall stand up in his estate a raiser of taxes in the glory
of the kingdom but within few days he shall be destroyed neither in
anger nor in battle

1121 And in his estate shall stand up a vile person to whom they
shall not give the honour of the kingdom but he shall come in
peaceably and obtain the kingdom by flatteries

1122 And with the arms of a flood shall they be overflown from before
him and shall be broken yea also the prince of the covenant

1123 And after the league made with him he shall work deceitfully
for he shall come up and shall become strong with a small people

1124 He shall enter peaceably even upon the fattest places of the
province and he shall do that which his fathers have not done nor
his fathers fathers he shall scatter among them the prey and spoil
and riches yea and he shall forecast his devices against the strong
holds even for a time

1125 And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king
of the south with a great army and the king of the south shall be
stirred up to battle with a very great and mighty army but he shall
not stand for they shall forecast devices against him

1126 Yea they that feed of the portion of his meat shall destroy
him and his army shall overflow and many shall fall down slain

1127 And both of these kings hearts shall be to do mischief and
they shall speak lies at one table but it shall not prosper for yet
the end shall be at the time appointed

1128 Then shall he return into his land with great riches and his
heart shall be against the holy covenant and he shall do exploits
and return to his own land

1129 At the time appointed he shall return and come toward the
south but it shall not be as the former or as the latter

1130 For the ships of Chittim shall come against him therefore he
shall be grieved and return and have indignation against the holy
covenant so shall he do he shall even return and have intelligence
with them that forsake the holy covenant

1131 And arms shall stand on his part and they shall pollute the
sanctuary of strength and shall take away the daily sacrifice and
they shall place the abomination that maketh desolate

1132 And such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt by
flatteries but the people that do know their God shall be strong and
do exploits
