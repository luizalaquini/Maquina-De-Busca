I hope so For your sake

Less than an hour later the trail led down a slope toward a muddy brook swollen by the recent rains It was there the dogs lost the scent Farlen and Wex waded across with the hounds and came back shaking their heads while the animals ranged up and down the far bank sniffing They went in here m’lord but I can’t see where they come out the kennelmaster said

Theon dismounted and knelt beside the stream He dipped a hand in it The water was cold They won’t have stayed long in this he said Take half the dogs downstream I’ll go up—

Wex clapped his hands together loudly

What is it Theon said

The mute boy pointed

The ground near the water was sodden and muddy The tracks the wolves had left were plain enough Pawprints yes So

Wex drove his heel into the mud and pivoted his foot this way and that It left a deep gouge

Joseth understood A man the size of Hodor ought to have left a deep print in this mud he said More so with the weight of a boy on his back Yet the only boot prints here are our own See for yourself

Appalled Theon saw it was true The wolves had gone into the turgid brown water alone Osha must have turned aside back of us Before the elk most likely She sent the wolves on by themselves hoping we’d chase after them He rounded on his huntsmen If you two have played me false—

There’s been only the one trail my lord I swear it said Gariss defensively And the direwolves would never have parted from them boys Not for long

That’s so Theon thought Summer and Shaggydog might have gone off to hunt but soon or late they would return to Bran and Rickon Gariss Murch take four dogs and double back find where we lost them Aggar you watch them I’ll have no trickery Farlen and I will follow the direwolves Give a blast on the horn when you pick up the trail Two blasts if you catch sight of the beasts themselves Once we find where they went they’ll lead us back to their masters

He took Wex the Frey boy and Gynir Rednose to search upstream He and Wex rode on one side of the brook Rednose and Walder Frey on the other each with a pair of hounds The wolves might have come out on either bank Theon kept an eye out for tracks spoor broken branches any hint as to where the direwolves might have left the water He spied the prints of deer elk and badger easily enough Wex surprised a vixen drinking at the stream and Walder flushed three rabbits from the underbrush and managed to put an arrow in one They saw the claw marks where a bear had shredded the bark of a tall birch But of the direwolves there was no sign

A little farther Theon told himself Past that oak over that rise past the next bend of the stream we’ll find something there He pressed on long after he knew he should turn back a growing sense of anxiety gnawing at his belly It was midday when he wrenched Smiler’s head round in disgust and gave up

Somehow Osha and the wretched boys were eluding him It should not have been possible not on foot burdened with a cripple and a young child Every passing hour increased the likelihood that they would make good their escape If they reach a village… The people of the north would never deny Ned Stark’s sons Robb’s brothers They’d have mounts to speed them on their way food Men would fight for the honor of protecting them The whole bloody north would rally around them

The wolves went downstream that’s all He clung to that thought That red bitch will sniff where they came out of the water and we’ll be after them again

But when they joined up with Farlen’s party one look at the kennelmaster’s face smashed all of Theon’s hopes to shards The only thing those dogs are fit for is a bear baiting he said angrily Would that I had a bear

The dogs are not at fault Farlen knelt between a mastiff and his precious red bitch a hand on each Running water don’t hold no scents m’lord

The wolves had to come out of the stream somewhere

No doubt they did Upstream or down We keep on we’ll find the place but which way

I never knew a wolf to run up a streambed for miles said Reek A man might If he knew he was being hunted he might But a wolf

Yet Theon wondered These beasts were not as other wolves I should have skinned the cursed things

It was the same tale all over again when they rejoined Gariss Murch and Aggar The huntsmen had retraced their steps halfway to Winterfell without finding any sign of where the Starks might have parted company with the direwolves Farlen’s hounds seemed as frustrated as their masters sniffing forlornly at trees and rocks and snapping irritably at each other

Theon dared not admit defeat We’ll return to the brook Search again This time we’ll go as far as we must

We won’t find them the Frey boy said suddenly Not so long as the frogeaters are with them Mudmen are sneaks they won’t fight like decent folks they skulk and use poison arrows You never see them but they see you Those who go into the bogs after them get lost and never come out Their houses move even the castles like Greywater Watch He glanced nervously at greenery that encircled them on all sides They might be out there right now listening to everything we say

Farlen laughed to show what he thought of that notion My dogs would smell anything in them bushes Be all over them before you could break wind boy

Frogeaters don’t smell like men Frey insisted They have a boggy stink like frogs and trees and scummy water Moss grows under their arms in place of hair and they can live with nothing to eat but mud and breathe swamp water
