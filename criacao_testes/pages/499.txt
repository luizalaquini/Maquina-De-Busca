8013 The boar out of the wood doth waste it and the wild beast of
the field doth devour it

8014 Return we beseech thee O God of hosts look down from heaven
and behold and visit this vine

8015 And the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted and the
branch that thou madest strong for thyself

8016 It is burned with fire it is cut down they perish at the
rebuke of thy countenance

8017 Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand upon the son of
man whom thou madest strong for thyself

8018 So will not we go back from thee quicken us and we will call
upon thy name

8019 Turn us again O LORD God of hosts cause thy face to shine and
we shall be saved



811 Sing aloud unto God our strength make a joyful noise unto the
God of Jacob

812 Take a psalm and bring hither the timbrel the pleasant harp
with the psaltery

813 Blow up the trumpet in the new moon in the time appointed on
our solemn feast day

814 For this was a statute for Israel and a law of the God of Jacob

815 This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony when he went out
through the land of Egypt where I heard a language that I understood
not

816 I removed his shoulder from the burden his hands were delivered
from the pots

817 Thou calledst in trouble and I delivered thee I answered thee
in the secret place of thunder I proved thee at the waters of
Meribah

Selah

818 Hear O my people and I will testify unto thee O Israel if
thou wilt hearken unto me

819 There shall no strange god be in thee neither shalt thou worship
any strange god

8110 I am the LORD thy God which brought thee out of the land of
Egypt open thy mouth wide and I will fill it

8111 But my people would not hearken to my voice and Israel would
none of me

8112 So I gave them up unto their own hearts lust and they walked
in their own counsels

8113 Oh that my people had hearkened unto me and Israel had walked
in my ways

8114 I should soon have subdued their enemies and turned my hand
against their adversaries

8115 The haters of the LORD should have submitted themselves unto
him but their time should have endured for ever

8116 He should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat and
with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied thee



821 God standeth in the congregation of the mighty he judgeth among
the gods

822 How long will ye judge unjustly and accept the persons of the
wicked Selah

823 Defend the poor and fatherless do justice to the afflicted and
needy

824 Deliver the poor and needy rid them out of the hand of the
wicked

825 They know not neither will they understand they walk on in
darkness all the foundations of the earth are out of course

826 I have said Ye are gods and all of you are children of the most
High

827 But ye shall die like men and fall like one of the princes

828 Arise O God judge the earth for thou shalt inherit all
nations
