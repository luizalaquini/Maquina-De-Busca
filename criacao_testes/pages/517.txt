the name of the LORD

1141 When Israel went out of Egypt the house of Jacob from a people
of strange language

1142 Judah was his sanctuary and Israel his dominion

1143 The sea saw it and fled Jordan was driven back

1144 The mountains skipped like rams and the little hills like
lambs

1145 What ailed thee O thou sea that thou fleddest thou Jordan
that thou wast driven back

1146 Ye mountains that ye skipped like rams and ye little hills
like lambs

1147 Tremble thou earth at the presence of the Lord at the
presence of the God of Jacob

1148 Which turned the rock into a standing water the flint into a
fountain of waters



1151 Not unto us O LORD not unto us but unto thy name give glory
for thy mercy and for thy truths sake

1152 Wherefore should the heathen say Where is now their God

1153 But our God is in the heavens he hath done whatsoever he hath
pleased

1154 Their idols are silver and gold the work of mens hands

1155 They have mouths but they speak not eyes have they but they
