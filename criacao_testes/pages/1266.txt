Jaqen is as dead as Arry he said sadly and I have promises to keep Valar morghulis Arya Stark Say it again

Valar morghulis she said once more and the stranger in Jaqen’s clothes bowed to her and stalked off through the darkness cloak swirling She was alone with the dead men They deserved to die Arya told herself remembering all those Ser Amory Lorch had killed at the holdfast by the lake

The cellars under Kingspyre were empty when she returned to her bed of straw She whispered her names to her pillow and when she was done she added Valar morghulis in a small soft voice wondering what it meant

Come dawn Pinkeye and the others were back all but one boy who’d been killed in the fighting for no reason that anyone could say Pinkeye went up alone to see how matters stood by light of day complaining all the while that his old bones could not abide steps When he returned he told them that Harrenhal had been taken Them Bloody Mummers killed some of Ser Amory’s lot in their beds and the rest at table after they were good and drunk The new lord will be here before the day’s out with his whole host He’s from the wild north up where that Wall is and they say he’s a hard one This lord or that lord there’s still work to be done Any foolery and I’ll whip the skin off your back He looked at Arya when he said that but never said a word to her about where she had been the night before

All morning she watched the Bloody Mummers strip the dead of their valuables and drag the corpses to the Flowstone Yard where a pyre was laid to dispose of them Shagwell the Fool hacked the heads off two dead knights and pranced about the castle swinging them by the hair and making them talk What did you die of one head asked Hot weasel soup replied the second

Arya was set to mopping up dried blood No one said a word to her beyond the usual but every so often she would notice people looking at her strangely Robett Glover and the other men they’d freed must have talked about what had happened down in the dungeon and then Shagwell and his stupid talking heads started in about the weasel soup She would have told him to shut up but she was scared to The fool was half-mad and she’d heard that he’d once killed a man for not laughing at one of his japes He better shut his mouth or I’ll put him on my list with the rest she thought as she scrubbed at a reddish-brown stain It was almost evenfall when the new master of Harrenhal arrived He had a plain face beardless and ordinary notable only for his queer pale eyes Neither plump thin nor muscular he wore black ringmail and a spotted pink cloak The sigil on his banner looked like a man dipped in blood On your knees for the Lord of the Dreadfort shouted his squire a boy no older than Arya and Harrenhal knelt

Vargo Hoat came forward My lord Harrenhal ith yourth

The lord gave answer but too softly for Arya to hear Robett Glover and Ser Aenys Frey freshly bathed and clad in clean new doublets and cloaks came up to join them After some brief talk Ser Aenys led them over to Rorge and Biter Arya was surprised to see them still here somehow she would have expected them to vanish when Jaqen did Arya heard the harsh sound of Rorge’s voice but not what he was saying Then Shagwell pounced on her dragging her out across the yard My lord my lord he sang tugging at her wrist here’s the weasel who made the soup

Let go Arya said wriggling out of his grasp

The lord regarded her Only his eyes moved they were very pale the color of ice How old are you child

She had to think for a moment to remember Ten

Ten my lord he reminded her Are you fond of animals

Some kinds My lord

A thin smile twitched across his lips But not lions it would seem Nor manticores

She did not know what to say to that so she said nothing

They tell me you are called Weasel That will not serve What name did your mother give you

She bit her lip groping for another name Lommy had called her Lumpyhead Sansa used Horseface and her father’s men once dubbed her Arya Underfoot but she did not think any of those were the sort of name he wanted

Nymeria she said Only she called me Nan for short

You will call me my lord when you speak to me Nan the lord said mildly You are too young to be a Brave Companion I think and of the wrong sex Are you afraid of leeches child

They’re only leeches My lord

My squire could take a lesson from you it would seem Frequent leechings are the secret of a long life A man must purge himself of bad blood You will do I think For so long as I remain at Harrenhal Nan you shall be my cupbearer and serve me at table and in chambers

This time she knew better than to say that she’d sooner work in the stables Yes your lord I mean my lord

The lord waved a hand Make her presentable he said to no one in particular and make certain she knows how to pour wine without spilling it Turning away he lifted a hand and said Lord Hoat see to those banners above the gatehouse

Four Brave Companions climbed to the ramparts and hauled down the lion of Lannister and Ser Amory’s own black manticore In their place they raised the flayed man of the Dreadfort and the direwolf of Stark And that evening a page named Nan poured wine for Roose Bolton and Vargo Hoat as they stood on the gallery watching the Brave Companions parade Ser Amory Lorch naked through the middle ward Ser Amory pleaded and sobbed and clung to the legs of his captors until Rorge pulled him loose and Shagwell kicked him down into the bear pit

The bear is all in black Arya thought Like Yoren She filled Roose Bolton’s cup and did not spill a drop





DAENERYS

In this city of splendors Dany had expected the House of the Undying Ones to be the most splendid of all but she emerged from her palanquin to behold a grey and ancient ruin

Long and low without towers or windows it coiled like a stone serpent through a grove of black-barked trees whose inky blue leaves made the stuff of the sorcerous drink the Qartheen called shade of the evening No other buildings stood near Black tiles covered the palace roof many fallen or broken the mortar between the stones was dry and crumbling She understood now why Xaro Xhoan Daxos called it the Palace of Dust Even Drogon seemed disquieted by the sight of it The black dragon hissed smoke seeping out between his sharp teeth

Blood of my blood Jhogo said in Dothraki this is an evil place a haunt of ghosts and maegi See how it drinks the morning sun Let us go before it drinks us as well

Ser Jorah Mormont came up beside them What power can they have if they live in that

Heed the wisdom of those who love you best said Xaro Xhoan Daxos lounging inside the palanquin Warlocks are bitter creatures who eat dust and drink of shadows They will give you naught They have naught to give

Aggo put a hand on his arakh Khaleesi it is said that many go into the Palace of Dust but few come out

It is said Jhogo agreed

We are blood of your blood said Aggo sworn to live and die as you do Let us walk with you in this dark place to keep you safe from harm

Some places even a khal must walk alone Dany said

Take me then Ser Jorah urged The risk—

Queen Daenerys must enter alone or not at all The warlock Pyat Pree stepped out from under the trees Has he been there all along Dany wondered Should she turn away now the doors of wisdom shall be closed to her forevermore

My pleasure barge awaits even now Xaro Xhoan Daxos called out Turn away from this folly most stubborn of queens I have flutists who will soothe your troubled soul with sweet music and a small girl whose tongue will make you sigh and melt

Ser Jorah Mormont gave the merchant prince a sour look Your Grace remember Mirri Maz Duur

I do Dany said suddenly decided I remember that she had knowledge And she was only a maegi

Pyat Pree smiled thinly The child speaks as sagely as a crone Take my arm and let me lead you

I am no child Dany took his arm nonetheless

It was darker than she would have thought under the black trees and the way was longer Though the path seemed to run straight from the street to the door of the palace Pyat Pree soon turned aside When she questioned him the warlock said only The front way leads in but never out again Heed my words my queen The House of the Undying Ones was not made for mortal men If you value your soul take care and do just as I tell you

I will do as you say Dany promised

When you enter you will find yourself in a room with four doors the one you have come through and three others Take the door to your right Each time the door to your right If you should come upon a stairwell climb Never go down and never take any door but the first door to your right

The door to my right Dany repeated I understand And when I leave the opposite

By no means Pyat Pree said Leaving and coming it is the same Always up Always the door to your right Other doors may open to you Within you will see many things that disturb you Visions of loveliness and visions of horror wonders and terrors Sights and sounds of days gone by and days to come and days that never were Dwellers and servitors may speak to you as you go Answer or ignore them as you choose but enter no room until you reach the audience chamber

I understand
