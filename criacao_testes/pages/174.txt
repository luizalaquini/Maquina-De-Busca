The animals were restless in their stalls whickering and snorting at the scent of blood Arya’s only plan was to saddle a horse and flee away from the castle and the city All she had to do was stay on the kingsroad and it would take her back to Winterfell She took a bridle and harness off the wall

As she crossed in back of the wagon a fallen chest caught her eye It must have been knocked down in the fight or dropped as it was being loaded The wood had split the lid opening to spill the chest’s contents across the ground Arya recognized silks and satins and velvets she never wore She might need warm clothes on the kingsroad though… and besides…

Arya knelt in the dirt among the scattered clothes She found a heavy woolen cloak a velvet skirt and a silk tunic and some smallclothes a dress her mother had embroidered for her a silver baby bracelet she might sell Shoving the broken lid out of the way she groped inside the chest for Needle She had hidden it way down at the bottom under everything but her stuff had all been jumbled around when the chest was dropped For a moment Arya was afraid someone had found the sword and stolen it Then her fingers felt the hardness of metal under a satin gown

There she is a voice hissed close behind her

Startled Arya whirled A stableboy stood behind her a smirk on his face his filthy white undertunic peeking out from beneath a soiled jerkin His boots were covered with manure and he had a pitchfork in one hand Who are you she asked

She don’t know me he said but I knows her oh yes The wolf girl

Help me saddle a horse Arya pleaded reaching back into the chest groping for Needle My father’s the Hand of the King he’ll reward you

Father’s dead the boy said He shuffled toward her It’s the queen who’ll be rewarding me Come here girl

Stay away Her fingers closed around Needle’s hilt

I says come He grabbed her arm hard

Everything Syrio Forel had ever taught her vanished in a heartbeat In that instant of sudden terror the only lesson Arya could remember was the one Jon Snow had given her the very first

She stuck him with the pointy end driving the blade upward with a wild hysterical strength

Needle went through his leather jerkin and the white flesh of his belly and came out between his shoulder blades The boy dropped the pitchfork and made a soft noise something between a gasp and a sigh His hands closed around the blade Oh gods he moaned as his undertunic began to redden Take it out

When she took it out he died

The horses were screaming Arya stood over the body still and frightened in the face of death Blood had gushed from the boy’s mouth as he collapsed and more was seeping from the slit in his belly pooling beneath his body His palms were cut where he’d grabbed at the blade She backed away slowly Needle red in her hand She had to get away someplace far from here someplace safe away from the stableboy’s accusing eyes

She snatched up the bridle and harness again and ran to her mare but as she lifted the saddle to the horse’s back Arya realized with a sudden sick dread that the castle gates would be closed Even the postern doors would likely be guarded Maybe the guards wouldn’t recognize her If they thought she was a boy perhaps they’d let her… no they’d have orders not to let anyone out it wouldn’t matter whether they knew her or not

But there was another way out of the castle…

The saddle slipped from Arya’s fingers and fell to the dirt with a thump and a puff of dust Could she find the room with the monsters again She wasn’t certain yet she knew she had to try

She found the clothing she’d gathered and slipped into the cloak concealing Needle beneath its folds The rest of her things she tied in a roll With the bundle under her arm she crept to the far end of the stable Unlatching the back door she peeked out anxiously She could hear the distant sound of swordplay and the shivery wail of a man screaming in pain across the bailey She would need to go down the serpentine steps past the small kitchen and the pig yard that was how she’d gone last time chasing the black tomcat… only that would take her right past the barracks of the gold cloaks She couldn’t go that way Arya tried to think of another way If she crossed to the other side of the castle she could creep along the river wall and through the little godswood… but first she’d have to cross the yard in the plain view of the guards on the walls

She had never seen so many men on the walls Gold cloaks most of them armed with spears Some of them knew her by sight What would they do if they saw her running across the yard She’d look so small from up there would they be able to tell who she was Would they care

She had to leave now she told herself but when the moment came she was too frightened to move

Calm as still water a small voice whispered in her ear Arya was so startled she almost dropped her bundle She looked around wildly but there was no one in the stable but her and the horses and the dead men

Quiet as a shadow she heard Was it her own voice or Syrio’s She could not tell yet somehow it calmed her fears

She stepped out of the stable

It was the scariest thing she’d ever done She wanted to run and hide but she made herself walk across the yard slowly putting one foot in front of the other as if she had all the time in the world and no reason to be afraid of anyone She thought she could feel their eyes like bugs crawling on her skin under her clothes Arya never looked up If she saw them watching all her courage would desert her she knew and she would drop the bundle of clothes and run and cry like a baby and then they would have her She kept her gaze on the ground By the time she reached the shadow of the royal sept on the far side of the yard Arya was cold with sweat but no one had raised the hue and cry

The sept was open and empty Inside half a hundred prayer candles burned in a fragrant silence Arya figured the gods would never miss two She stuffed them up her sleeves and left by a back window Sneaking back to the alley where she had cornered the one-eared tom was easy but after that she got lost She crawled in and out of windows hopped over walls and felt her way through dark cellars quiet as a shadow Once she heard a woman weeping It took her more than an hour to find the low narrow window that slanted down to the dungeon where the monsters waited

She tossed her bundle through and doubled back to light her candle That was chancy the fire she’d remembered seeing had burnt down to embers and she heard voices as she was blowing on the coals Cupping her fingers around the flickering candle she went out the window as they were coming in the door without ever getting a glimpse of who it was
