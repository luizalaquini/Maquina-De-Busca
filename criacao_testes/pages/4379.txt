FG Table 93  Success of simple intonation assignment rules
pp
Applying the simple rules given above to the text of Table 92 leads to
the results in the first column of Table 93
Three-quarters of the foot boundaries are flagged by
punctuation marks with no extraneous ones being included
88 of tone groups have a tonic syllable at the start of the final foot
However the compound tone groups each have two tonic syllables
and of course only the second one is predicted by the final-foot rule
Assigning intonation contours on the extremely simple basis of using
contour 4 for the first tone group in a paragraph and contour 1 thereafter
also seems to work quite well  Secondary contours such as 1+ and 1-
have been mapped into the appropriate primary contour 1 in this case
for the present purpose and compound tone groups have been assigned the first
contour of the pair
The result is that 68 of contours are given correctly
pp
In order to give some idea of the reliability of these figures the results
for the whole passage transcribed by Halliday em of which Table 92 is an
excerpt em are shown in the second column of Table 93  Although it
looks as though the rules may have been slightly lucky with the excerpt
the general trends are the same with 65 to 80 of features being assigned
correctly
It could be argued though that the complete text is punctuated fairly liberally by
present-day standards so that the tone-group boundary rule is unusually
successful
pp
These results are really astonishingly good considering the crudeness of
the rules  However they should be interpreted with caution
What is missed by the rules although appearing to comprise only
20 to 35 of the features is certain to include the important
information-bearing and variety-producing features that give the utterance
its liveliness and interest
It would be rash to assume that all tone-group boundaries
all tonic positions and all intonation contours are equally
important for intelligibility and naturalness
It is much more likely that the rules predict a
default pattern while most information is borne by deviations from
them
To give an engineering analogy it may be as though the carrier waveform
of a modulated transmission is being simulated instead of the
information-bearing signal
Certainly the utterance will if synthesized with intonation given by these
rules sound extremely dull and repetitive mainly because of the
overwhelming predominance of tone group 1 and the universal placement
of tonic stress on the final foot
pp
There are certainly many different ways to orate any particular text
and that given by Halliday and reproduced in Table 92 is only one possible
version
However it is fair to say that the default intonation discussed above
could only occur naturally under very unusual circumstances em such as
a petulant child unwilling and sulky having been forced to read aloud
This is hardly how we want our computers to speak
rh Rhythm analysis
Consider now how to decide where foot boundaries should be placed
in English text
Clearly semantic considerations sometimes play a part in this em one could
say
LB
 is this train going to London
LE
instead of the more usual
LB
 is this train going to London
LE
in circumstances where the train might be going
ul
to
or
ul
from
London
Such effects are ignored here although it is worth noting in passing that the
rogue words will often be marked by underscoring or italicizing
as in the previous sentence
If the text is liberally underlined semantic analysis may
be unnecessary for the purposes of rhythm
pp
A rough and ready rule for placing foot boundaries is to insert one before
each word which is not in a small closed set of function words
The set includes for example a and but for is the to
If a verb or adjective begins with a prefix the boundary should be moved
between it and the root em but not for a noun
This will give the distinction between
