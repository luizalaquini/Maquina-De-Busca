The guards were shouting outside the door pounding with the butts of their heavy spears Lord Petyr pulled Sansa to her feet You’re not hurt When she shook her head he said Run let my guards in then Quick now there’s no time to lose This singer’s killed my lady wife





Epilogue


The road up to Oldstones went twice around the hill before reaching the summit Overgrown and stony it would have been slow going even in the best of times and last night’s snow had left it muddy as well Snow in autumn in the riverlands it’s unnatural Merrett thought gloomily It had not been much of a snow true just enough to blanket the ground for a night Most of it had started melting away as soon as the sun came up Still Merrett took it for a bad omen Between rains floods fire and war they had lost two harvests and a good part of a third An early winter would mean famine all across the riverlands A great many people would go hungry and some of them would starve Merrett only hoped he wouldn’t be one of them I may though With my luck I just may I never did have any luck

Beneath the castle ruins the lower slopes of the hill were so thickly forested that half a hundred outlaws could well have been lurking there They could be watching me even now Merrett glanced about and saw nothing but gorse bracken thistle sedge and blackberry bushes between the pines and grey-green sentinels Elsewhere skeletal elm and ash and scrub oaks choked the ground like weeds He saw no outlaws but that meant little Outlaws were better at hiding than honest men

Merrett hated the woods if truth be told and he hated outlaws even more Outlaws stole my life he had been known to complain when in his cups He was too often in his cups his father said often and loudly Too true he thought ruefully You needed some sort of distinction in the Twins else they were liable to forget you were alive but a reputation as the biggest drinker in the castle had done little to enhance his prospects he’d found I once hoped to be the greatest knight who ever couched a lance The gods took that away from me Why shouldn’t I have a cup of wine from time to time It helps my headaches Besides my wife is a shrew my father despises me my children are worthless What do I have to stay sober for

He was sober now though Well he’d had two horns of ale when he broke his fast and a small cup of red when he set out but that was just to keep his head from pounding Merrett could feel the headache building behind his eyes and he knew that if he gave it half a chance he would soon feel as if he had a thunderstorm raging between his ears Sometimes his headaches got so bad that it even hurt too much to weep Then all he could do was rest on his bed in a dark room with a damp cloth over his eyes and curse his luck and the nameless outlaw who had done this to him

Just thinking about it made him anxious He could no wise afford a headache now If I bring Petyr back home safely all my luck will change He had the gold all he needed to do was climb to the top of Oldstones meet the bloody outlaws in the ruined castle and make the exchange A simple ransom Even he could not muck it up… unless he got a headache one so bad that it left him unable to ride He was supposed to be at the ruins by sunset not weeping in a huddle at the side of the road Merrett rubbed two fingers against his temple Once more around the hill and there I am When the message had come in and he had stepped forward to offer to carry the ransom his father had squinted down and said You Merrett and started laughing through his nose that hideous heh heh heh laugh of his Merrett practically had to beg before they’d give him the bloody bag of gold

Something moved in the underbrush along the side of the road Merrett reined up hard and reached for his sword but it was only a squirrel Stupid he told himself shoving the sword back in its scabbard without ever having gotten it out Outlaws don’t have tails Bloody hell Merrett get hold of yourself His heart was thumping in his chest as if he were some green boy on his first campaign As if this were the kingswood and it was the old Brotherhood I was going to face not the lightning lord’s sorry lot of brigands For a moment he was tempted to trot right back down the hill and find the nearest alehouse That bag of gold would buy a lot of ale enough for him to forget all about Petyr Pimple Let them hang him he brought this on himself It’s no more than he deserves wandering off with some bloody camp follower like a stag in rut

His head had begun to pound soft now but he knew it would get worse Merrett rubbed the bridge of his nose He really had no right to think so ill of Petyr I did the same myself when I was his age In his case all it got him was a pox but still he shouldn’t condemn Whores did have charms especially if you had a face like Petyr’s The poor lad had a wife to be sure but she was half the problem Not only was she twice his age but she was bedding his brother Walder too if the talk was true There was always lots of talk around the Twins and only a little was ever true but in this case Merrett believed it Black Walder was a man who took what he wanted even his brother’s wife He’d had Edwyn’s wife too that was common knowledge Fair Walda had been known to slip into his bed from time to time and some even said he’d known the seventh Lady Frey a deal better than he should have Small wonder he refused to marry Why buy a cow when there were udders all around begging to be milked

Cursing under his breath Merrett jammed his heels into his horse’s flanks and rode on up the hill As tempting as it was to drink the gold away he knew that if he didn’t come back with Petyr Pimple he had as well not come back at all

Lord Walder would soon turn two-and-ninety His ears had started to go his eyes were almost gone and his gout was so bad that he had to be carried everywhere He could not possibly last much longer all his sons agreed And when he goes everything will change and not for the better His father was querulous and stubborn with an iron will and a wasp’s tongue but he did believe in taking care of his own All of his own even the ones who had displeased and disappointed him Even the ones whose names he can’t remember Once he was gone though…

When Ser Stevron had been heir that was one thing The old man had been grooming Stevron for sixty years and had pounded it into his head that blood was blood But Stevron had died whilst campaigning with the Young Wolf in the west—of waiting no doubt Lame Lothar had quipped when the raven brought them the news—and his sons and grandsons were a different sort of Frey Stevron’s son Ser Ryman stood to inherit now a thick-witted stubborn greedy man And after Ryman came his own sons Edwyn and Black Walder who were even worse Fortunately Lame Lothar once said they hate each other even more than they hate us

Merrett wasn’t certain that was fortunate at all and for that matter Lothar himself might be more dangerous than either of them Lord Walder had ordered the slaughter of the Starks at Roslin’s wedding but it had been Lame Lothar who had plotted it out with Roose Bolton all the way down to which songs would be played Lothar was a very amusing fellow to get drunk with but Merrett would never be so foolish as to turn his back on him In the Twins you learned early that only full blood siblings could be trusted and them not very far

It was like to be every son for himself when the old man died and every daughter as well The new Lord of the Crossing would doubtless keep on some of his uncles nephews and cousins at the Twins the ones he happened to like or trust or more likely the ones he thought would prove useful to him The rest of us he’ll shove out to fend for ourselves

The prospect worried Merrett more than words could say He would be forty in less than three years too old to take up the life of a hedge knight… even if he’d been a knight which as it happened he wasn’t He had no land no wealth of his own He owned the clothes on his back but not much else not even the horse he was riding He wasn’t clever enough to be a maester pious enough to be a septon or savage enough to be a sellsword The gods gave me no gift but birth and they stinted me there What good was it to be the son of a rich and powerful House if you were the ninth son When you took grandsons and great-grandsons into account Merrett stood a better chance of being chosen High Septon than he did of inheriting the Twins

I have no luck he thought bitterly I have never had any bloody luck He was a big man broad around the chest and shoulders if only of middling height In the last ten years he had grown soft and fleshy he knew but when he’d been younger Merrett had been almost as robust as Ser Hosteen his eldest full brother who was commonly regarded as the strongest of Lord Walder Frey’s brood As a boy he’d been packed off to Crakehall to serve his mother’s family as a page When old Lord Sumner had made him a squire everyone had assumed he would be Ser Merrett in no more than a few years but the outlaws of the Kingswood Brotherhood had pissed on those plans While his fellow squire Jaime Lannister was covering himself in glory Merrett had first caught the pox from a camp follower then managed to get captured by a woman the one called the White Fawn Lord Sumner had ransomed him back from the outlaws but in the very next fight he’d been felled by a blow from a mace that had broken his helm and left him insensible for a fortnight Everyone gave him up for dead they told him later

Merrett hadn’t died but his fighting days were done Even the lightest blow to his head brought on blinding pain and reduced him to tears Under these circumstances knighthood was out of the question Lord Sumner told him not unkindly He was sent back to the Twins to face Lord Walder’s poisonous disdain

After that Merrett’s luck had only grown worse His father had managed to make a good marriage for him somehow he wed one of Lord Darry’s daughters back when the Darrys stood high in King Aerys’s favor But it seemed as if he no sooner had deflowered his bride than Aerys lost his throne Unlike the Freys the Darrys had been prominent Targaryen loyalists which cost them half their lands most of their wealth and almost all their power As for his lady wife she found him a great disappointment from the first and insisted on popping out nothing but girls for years three live ones a stillbirth and one that died in infancy before she finally produced a son His eldest daughter had turned out to be a slut his second a glutton When Ami was caught in the stables with no fewer than three grooms he’d been forced to marry her off to a bloody hedge knight That situation could not possibly get any worse he’d thought… until Ser Pate decided he could win renown by defeating Ser Gregor Clegane Ami had come running back a widow to Merrett’s dismay and the undoubted delight of every stablehand in the Twins

Merrett had dared to hope that his luck was finally changing when Roose Bolton chose to wed his Walda instead of one of her slimmer comelier cousins The Bolton alliance was important for House Frey and his daughter had helped secure it he thought that must surely count for something The old man had soon disabused him He picked her because she’s fat Lord Walder said You think Bolton gave a mummer’s fart that she was your whelp Think he sat about thinking ‘Heh Merrett Muttonhead that’s the very man I need for a good-father’ Your Walda’s a sow in silk that’s why he picked her and I’m not like to thank you for it We’d have had the same alliance at half the price if your little porkling put down her spoon from time to time

The final humiliation had been delivered with a smile when Lame Lothar had summoned him to discuss his role in Roslin’s wedding We must each play our part according to our gifts his half-brother told him You shall have one task and one task only Merrett but I believe you are well suited to it I want you to see to it that Greatjon Umber is so bloody drunk that he can hardly stand let alone fight

And even that I failed at He’d cozened the huge northman into drinking enough wine to kill any three normal men yet after Roslin had been bedded the Greatjon still managed to snatch the sword of the first man to accost him and break his arm in the snatching It had taken eight of them to get him into chains and the effort had left two men wounded one dead and poor old Ser Leslyn Haigh short half a ear When he couldn’t fight with his hands any longer Umber had fought with his teeth

Merrett paused a moment and closed his eyes His head was throbbing like that bloody drum they’d played at the wedding and for a moment it was all he could do to stay in the saddle I have to go on he told himself If he could bring back Petyr Pimple surely it would put him in Ser Ryman’s good graces Petyr might be a whisker on the hapless side but he wasn’t as cold as Edwyn nor as hot as Black Walder The boy will be grateful for my part and his father will see that I’m loyal a man worth having about

But only if he was there by sunset with the gold Merrett glanced at the sky Right on time He needed something to steady his hands He pulled up the waterskin hung from his saddle uncorked it and took a long swallow The wine was thick and sweet so dark it was almost black but gods it tasted good

The curtain wall of Oldstones had once encircled the brow of the hill like the crown on a king’s head Only the foundation remained and a few waist-high piles of crumbling stone spotted with lichen Merrett rode along the line of the wall until he came to the place where the gatehouse would have stood The ruins were more extensive here and he had to dismount to lead his palfrey through them In the west the sun had vanished behind a bank of low clouds Gorse and bracken covered the slopes and once inside the vanished walls the weeds were chest high Merrett loosened his sword in its scabbard and looked about warily but saw no outlaws Could I have come on the wrong day He stopped and rubbed his temples with his thumbs but that did nothing to ease the pressure behind his eyes Seven bloody hells…
