effects caused by tongue and jaw inertia can be modelled directly
However this potential has
not yet been realized
Speech from current articulatory models is of much poorer quality than
that from acoustically-based synthesis methods
The major problem is in gaining data about articulatory
behaviour during running speech em it is much easier to perform acoustic
analysis on the resulting sound than it is to examine the vocal organs in
action  Because of this the subject is not treated in this book
We will only look at articulatory properties insofar as they help us
to understand in a qualitative way the acoustic nature of speech
pp
Speech however is much more than mere articulation
Consider em admittedly a rather extreme and chauvinistic example em the
number of ways a girl can say yes
Breathy voice slow tempo low pitch em these are all characteristics which
affect the utterance as a whole rather than being classifiable into
individual sound segments  Linguists call them prosodic or
suprasegmental features for they relate to overall aspects of the
utterance and distinguish them from segmental ones which concern
the articulation of individual segments of syllables
The most important prosodic features are pitch or fundamental frequency
of the voice and rhythm
pp
This chapter provides a brief introduction to the nature of the speech
signal  Depending upon what speech output techniques we use it may be
necessary to understand something of the acoustic nature of the speech
signal the system that generates it the vocal tract commonly-used
classifications of sound segments and the prosodic aspects of speech
This material is little used in the early chapters of the book but
becomes increasingly important as the story unfolds
Hence you may skip the remainder of this chapter if you wish but
should return to it later to pick up more background whenever it
becomes necessary
sh 21  The anatomy of speech
pp
The so-called voiced sounds of speech em like the sound you make when
you say aaah em are produced by passing air up from the lungs through
the larynx or voicebox which is situated just behind the Adams apple
The vocal tract from the larynx to the lips acts as a resonant cavity
amplifying certain frequencies and attenuating others
pp
The waveform generated by the larynx however is not simply sinusoidal
If it were the vocal tract resonances would merely
give a sine wave of the same frequency but amplified or
attenuated according to how close it was to the nearest resonance  The
larynx contains two folds of skin em the vocal cords em which blow apart and flap
together again in each cycle of the pitch period
The pitch of a male voice in speech varies from as low as 50 Hz
cycles per second to perhaps
250 Hz with a typical median value of 100 Hz
For a female voice the range is higher up to about 500 Hz in speech
Singing can go much higher  a top C sung by a soprano has a frequency
of just over 1000 Hz and some opera singers can reach
substantially higher than this
pp
The flapping action of the vocal cords
gives a waveform which can be approximated by a
triangular pulse this and other approximations will be discussed in
Chapter 5
It has a rich spectrum of harmonics
decaying at around 12 dBoctave and each harmonic is affected
by the vocal tract resonances
rh Vocal tract resonances
A simple model of the vocal tract is an organ-pipe-like cylindrical tube
Figure 21
with a sound source at one end the larynx and open at the other the lips
FC Figure 21
This has resonances at wavelengths 4L 4L3 4L5  where L
is the length of the tube
and these correspond to frequencies c4L 3c4L 5c4L  Hz c
being the speed of
sound in air
Calculating these frequencies using a typical figure for the
distance between larynx and lips of 17 cm
and c = 340 ms for the speed of sound leads to resonances at
approximately 500 Hz 1500 Hz 2500 Hz  
pp
When excited by the harmonic-rich waveform of the larynx
the vocal tract resonances produce
peaks known as
ul
formants
in the energy spectrum of the speech wave Figure 22
FC Figure 22
The lowest formant called formant one varies from around 200 Hz
to 1000 Hz during speech the exact range depending on the size
of the vocal tract
Formant two varies from around 500 to 2500 Hz and formant three
from around 1500 to 3500 Hz
pp
You can easily hear the lowest formant by whispering the vowels in
the words heed hid head had hod hawed and whod
They appear to have a steadily descending pitch yet since you are
whispering there is no fundamental frequency
What you hear is the lowest resonance of the vocal tract em formant one
Some masochistic people can play simple tunes with this formant by putting
their mouth in successive vowel shapes and knocking the top of their head
with their knuckles em hard
