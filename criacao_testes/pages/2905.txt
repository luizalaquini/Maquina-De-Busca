thou trust his truth shall be thy shield and buckler

915 Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night nor for the
arrow that flieth by day

916 Nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness nor for the
destruction that wasteth at noonday

917 A thousand shall fall at thy side and ten thousand at thy right
hand but it shall not come nigh thee

918 Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the
wicked

919 Because thou hast made the LORD which is my refuge even the
most High thy habitation

9110 There shall no evil befall thee neither shall any plague come
nigh thy dwelling

9111 For he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in
all thy ways

9112 They shall bear thee up in their hands lest thou dash thy foot
against a stone

9113 Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder the young lion and the
dragon shalt thou trample under feet

9114 Because he hath set his love upon me therefore will I deliver
him I will set him on high because he hath known my name

9115 He shall call upon me and I will answer him I will be with him
in trouble I will deliver him and honour him

9116 With long life will I satisfy him and shew him my salvation



921 It is a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord and to sing
praises unto thy name O most High

922 To shew forth thy lovingkindness in the morning and thy
faithfulness every night

923 Upon an instrument of ten strings and upon the psaltery upon
the harp with a solemn sound

924 For thou LORD hast made me glad through thy work I will
triumph in the works of thy hands

925 O LORD how great are thy works and thy thoughts are very deep

926 A brutish man knoweth not neither doth a fool understand this

927 When the wicked spring as the grass and when all the workers of
iniquity do flourish it is that they shall be destroyed for ever

928 But thou LORD art most high for evermore

929 For lo thine enemies O LORD for lo thine enemies shall
perish all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered

9210 But my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of an unicorn I
shall be anointed with fresh oil

9211 Mine eye also shall see my desire on mine enemies and mine ears
shall hear my desire of the wicked that rise up against me

9212 The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree he shall grow
like a cedar in Lebanon

9213 Those that be planted in the house of the LORD shall flourish in
the courts of our God

9214 They shall still bring forth fruit in old age they shall be fat
and flourishing

9215 To shew that the LORD is upright he is my rock and there is no
unrighteousness in him



931 The LORD reigneth he is clothed with majesty the LORD is
clothed with strength wherewith he hath girded himself the world
also is stablished that it cannot be moved

932 Thy throne is established of old thou art from everlasting

933 The floods have lifted up O LORD the floods have lifted up
their voice the floods lift up their waves

934 The LORD on high is mightier than the noise of many waters yea
than the mighty waves of the sea

935 Thy testimonies are very sure holiness becometh thine house O
LORD for ever
