automatically  Yet hand-editing of formant parameters adds a whole new
dimension to the problem of vocabulary construction for it is
an exceedingly tiresome and time-consuming task
Even after such tweaking resynthesized utterances will be degraded
considerably from the original for the source-filter model is by no means
a perfect one
A hardware or real-time software formant synthesizer must be added
to the system presenting design problems and creating extra cost
Should a serial or parallel synthesizer be used em the latter offers
potentially better speech especially in nasal sounds but requires
additional parameters namely formant amplitudes to be estimated
Finally as we will see in the next chapter it is not an easy matter to
generate a suitable pitch contour and apply it to the utterance

Strangely enough the interpolation itself does not present any great
difficulty for there is not enough information in the formant-coded
words to make possible sophisticated coarticulation
The need for interpolation is most pressing when one word ends with
a voiced sound and the next begins with one
If either the end of the first or the beginning of the second word
or both is unvoiced unnatural formant transitions do not matter
for they will not be heard
Actually this is only strictly true for fricative transitions  if
the juncture is aspirated then formants will be perceived in the
aspiration  However
ul
h
is the only fully aspirated sound in English
and it is relatively uncommon
It is not absolutely necessary to interpolate the fricative filter resonance
because smooth transitions from one fricative sound to another are rare
in natural speech
pp
Hence unless both sides of the junction are voiced no interpolation
is needed  simple abuttal of the stored parameter tracks will do
Note that this is

not
the same as joining time waveforms for the synthesizer
will automatically ensure a relatively smooth transition from one
segment to another because of energy storage in the filters
A new set of resonance parameters for the formant-coded words will be stored
every 10 or 20 msec see Chapter 5 and so the transition will automatically
be smoothed over this time period
pp
For voiced-to-voiced transitions some interpolation is needed
An overlap period of duration say 50 msec is established and
the resonance parameters in the final 50 msec of the first word are
averaged with those in the first 50 msec of the second
The average is weighted with the first words formants dominating
at the beginning and their effect progressively dying out
in favour of the second word
pp
More sophisticated than a simple average is to weight the components
according to how rapidly they are changing
If the spectral change in one word is much greater than that in the
other we might expect that this will dominate the transition
A simple measure of spectral derivative at any given time can be found
by adding the magnitude of the discrepancies in each formant frequency
between one sample and the next
The spectral change in the transition region can be obtained by summing
the spectral derivatives at each sample in the region
Such a measure can perhaps be made more accurate by taking into
account the relative importance of the formants but will probably
never be more than a rough and ready yardstick
At any rate it can be used to load the average in favour of the
dominant side of the junction
pp
Much more important for naturalness of the speech are the effects
of rhythm and intonation discussed in the next chapter

Significant improvement at the 5 level of statistical
significance in peoples
ability to recall numbers was found for this method over direct
abuttal of either natural or synthetic versions of the digits
Although the method seemed on balance to produce utterances that were
recalled less accurately than completely natural spoken
telephone numbers the difference was not significant at the 5 level
The system was also used to generate wiring instructions by computer
directly from the connection list as described in Chapter 1
As noted there synthetic speech was actually preferred to natural speech
in the noisy environment of the production line
rh Joining linear predictive coded words
Because obtaining accurate formant tracks for natural utterances
by Fourier transform methods is difficult it is worth considering
the use of linear prediction as the source-filter model
Actually formant resonances can be extracted from linear predictive
coefficients quite easily but there is no need to do this because
the reflection coefficients themselves are quite suitable
for interpolation
