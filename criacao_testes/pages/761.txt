No corn He has no corn Sam closed the Old Bear’s eyes and tried to think of a prayer but all that came to mind was Mother have mercy Mother have mercy Mother have mercy

Your mother can’t help you none said the old woman on the left That dead old man can’t neither You take his sword and you take that big warm far cloak o’ his and you take his horse if you can find him And you go

The girl don’t lie the old woman on the right said She’s my girl and I beat the lying out of her early on You said you’d help her Do what Ferny says boy Take the girl and be quick about it

Quick the raven said Quick quick quick

Where asked Sam puzzled Where should I take her

Someplace warm the two old women said as one

Gilly was crying Me and the babe Please I’ll be your wife like I was Craster’s Please ser crow He’s a boy just like Nella said he’d be If you don’t take him they will

They said Sam and the raven cocked its black head and echoed They They They

The boy’s brothers said the old woman on the left Craster’s sons The white cold’s rising out there crow I can feel it in my bones These poor old bones don’t lie They’ll be here soon the sons





Arya


Her eyes had grown accustomed to blackness When Harwin pulled the hood off her head the ruddy glare inside the hollow hill made Arya blink like some stupid owl

A huge firepit had been dug in the center of the earthen floor and its flames rose swirling and crackling toward the smoke-stained ceiling The walls were equal parts stone and soil with huge white roots twisting through them like a thousand slow pale snakes People were emerging from between those roots as she watched edging out from the shadows for a look at the captives stepping from the mouths of pitch-black tunnels popping out of crannies and crevices on all sides In one place on the far side of the fire the roots formed a kind of stairway up to a hollow in the earth where a man sat almost lost in the tangle of weirwood

Lem unhooded Gendry What is this place he asked

An old place deep and secret A refuge where neither wolves nor lions come prowling

Neither wolves nor lions Arya’s skin prickled She remembered the dream she’d had and the taste of blood when she tore the man’s arm from his shoulder

Big as the fire was the cave was bigger it was hard to tell where it began and where it ended The tunnel mouths might have been two feet deep or gone on two miles Arya saw men and women and little children all of them watching her warily

Greenbeard said Here’s the wizard skinny squirrel You’ll get your answers now He pointed toward the fire where Tom Sevenstrings stood talking to a tall thin man with oddments of old armor buckled on over his ratty pink robes That can’t be Thoros of Myr Arya remembered the red priest as fat with a smooth face and a shiny bald head This man had a droopy face and a full head of shaggy grey hair Something Tom said made him look at her and Arya thought he was about to come over to her Only then the Mad Huntsman appeared shoving his captive down into the light and she and Gendry were forgotten

The Huntsman had turned out to be a stocky man in patched tan leathers balding and weak-chinned and quarrelsome At Stoney Sept she had thought that Lem and Greenbeard might be torn to pieces when they faced him at the crow cages to claim his captive for the lightning lord The hounds had been all around them sniffing and snarling But Tom o’ Sevens soothed them with his playing Tansy marched across the square with her apron full of bones and fatty mutton and Lem pointed out Anguy in the brothel window standing with an arrow notched The Mad Huntsman had cursed them all for lickspittles but finally he had agreed to take his prize to Lord Beric for judgment

They had bound his wrists with hempen rope strung a noose around his neck and pulled a sack down over his head but even so there was danger in the man Arya could feel it across the cave Thoros—if that was Thoros—met captor and captive halfway to the fire How did you take him the priest asked

The dogs caught the scent He was sleeping off a drunk under a willow tree if you believe it

Betrayed by his own kind Thoros turned to the prisoner and yanked his hood off Welcome to our humble hall dog It is not so grand as Robert’s throne room but the company is better

The shifting flames painted Sandor Clegane’s burned face with orange shadows so he looked even more terrible than he did in daylight When he pulled at the rope that bound his wrists flakes of dry blood fell off The Hound’s mouth twitched I know you he said to Thoros

You did In mêlées you’d curse my flaming sword though thrice I overthrew you with it

Thoros of Myr You used to shave your head

To betoken a humble heart but in truth my heart was vain Besides I lost my razor in the woods The priest slapped his belly I am less than I was but more A year in the wild will melt the flesh off a man Would that I could find a tailor to take in my skin I might look young again and pretty maids would shower me with kisses
