the trespass offering before the LORD for his sin which he hath done
and the sin which he hath done shall be forgiven him

1923 And when ye shall come into the land and shall have planted all
manner of trees for food then ye shall count the fruit thereof as
uncircumcised three years shall it be as uncircumcised unto you it
shall not be eaten of

1924 But in the fourth year all the fruit thereof shall be holy to
praise the LORD withal

1925 And in the fifth year shall ye eat of the fruit thereof that it
may yield unto you the increase thereof I am the LORD your God

1926 Ye shall not eat any thing with the blood neither shall ye use
enchantment nor observe times

1927 Ye shall not round the corners of your heads neither shalt thou
mar the corners of thy beard

1928 Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead nor
print any marks upon you I am the LORD

1929 Do not prostitute thy daughter to cause her to be a whore lest
the land fall to whoredom and the land become full of wickedness

1930 Ye shall keep my sabbaths and reverence my sanctuary I am the
LORD

1931 Regard not them that have familiar spirits neither seek after
wizards to be defiled by them I am the LORD your God

1932 Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head and honour the face of
the old man and fear thy God I am the LORD

1933 And if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land ye shall not
vex him

1934 But the stranger that dwelleth with you shall be unto you as one
born among you and thou shalt love him as thyself for ye were
strangers in the land of Egypt I am the LORD your God

1935 Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment in meteyard in
weight or in measure

1936 Just balances just weights a just ephah and a just hin shall
ye have I am the LORD your God which brought you out of the land of
Egypt

1937 Therefore shall ye observe all my statutes and all my
judgments and do them I am the LORD

201 And the LORD spake unto Moses saying 202 Again thou shalt say
to the children of Israel Whosoever he be of the children of Israel
or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel that giveth any of his
seed unto Molech he shall surely be put to death the people of the
land shall stone him with stones

203 And I will set my face against that man and will cut him off
from among his people because he hath given of his seed unto Molech
to defile my sanctuary and to profane my holy name

204 And if the people of the land do any ways hide their eyes from
the man when he giveth of his seed unto Molech and kill him not
205 Then I will set my face against that man and against his family
and will cut him off and all that go a whoring after him to commit
whoredom with Molech from among their people

206 And the soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits
and after wizards to go a whoring after them I will even set my face
against that soul and will cut him off from among his people

207 Sanctify yourselves therefore and be ye holy for I am the LORD
your God

208 And ye shall keep my statutes and do them I am the LORD which
sanctify you

209 For every one that curseth his father or his mother shall be
surely put to death he hath cursed his father or his mother his
blood shall be upon him

2010 And the man that committeth adultery with another mans wife
even he that committeth adultery with his neighbours wife the
adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death

2011 And the man that lieth with his fathers wife hath uncovered his
fathers nakedness both of them shall surely be put to death their
blood shall be upon them

2012 And if a man lie with his daughter in law both of them shall
surely be put to death they have wrought confusion their blood shall
be upon them

2013 If a man also lie with mankind as he lieth with a woman both
of them have committed an abomination they shall surely be put to
death their blood shall be upon them

2014 And if a man take a wife and her mother it is wickedness they
shall be burnt with fire both he and they that there be no
