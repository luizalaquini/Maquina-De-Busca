824 Deliver the poor and needy rid them out of the hand of the
wicked

825 They know not neither will they understand they walk on in
darkness all the foundations of the earth are out of course

826 I have said Ye are gods and all of you are children of the most
High

827 But ye shall die like men and fall like one of the princes

828 Arise O God judge the earth for thou shalt inherit all
nations



831 Keep not thou silence O God hold not thy peace and be not
still O God

832 For lo thine enemies make a tumult and they that hate thee
have lifted up the head

833 They have taken crafty counsel against thy people and consulted
against thy hidden ones

834 They have said Come and let us cut them off from being a
nation that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance

835 For they have consulted together with one consent they are
confederate against thee

836 The tabernacles of Edom and the Ishmaelites of Moab and the
Hagarenes

837 Gebal and Ammon and Amalek the Philistines with the
inhabitants of Tyre

838 Assur also is joined with them they have holpen the children of
Lot

Selah

839 Do unto them as unto the Midianites as to Sisera as to Jabin
at the brook of Kison

8310 Which perished at Endor they became as dung for the earth

8311 Make their nobles like Oreb and like Zeeb yea all their
princes as Zebah and as Zalmunna

8312 Who said Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in
possession

8313 O my God make them like a wheel as the stubble before the
wind

8314 As the fire burneth a wood and as the flame setteth the
mountains on fire

8315 So persecute them with thy tempest and make them afraid with
thy storm

8316 Fill their faces with shame that they may seek thy name O
LORD

8317 Let them be confounded and troubled for ever yea let them be
put to shame and perish

8318 That men may know that thou whose name alone is JEHOVAH art
the most high over all the earth



841 How amiable are thy tabernacles O LORD of hosts

842 My soul longeth yea even fainteth for the courts of the LORD
my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God

843 Yea the sparrow hath found an house and the swallow a nest for
herself where she may lay her young even thine altars O LORD of
hosts my King and my God

844 Blessed are they that dwell in thy house they will be still
praising thee Selah

845 Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee in whose heart are
the ways of them

846 Who passing through the valley of Baca make it a well the rain
also filleth the pools

847 They go from strength to strength every one of them in Zion
appeareth before God

848 O LORD God of hosts hear my prayer give ear O God of Jacob
Selah

849 Behold O God our shield and look upon the face of thine
anointed
