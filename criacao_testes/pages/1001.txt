Section 4  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment  Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit httppglaforg

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States  US laws alone swamp our small staff

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks online payments and credit card donations

Section 5  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works

Professor Michael S Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone  For thirty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included  Thus we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility

     httpwwwgutenbergorg

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation how to help produce our new eBooks and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks


We should start back Gared urged as the woods began to grow dark around them The wildlings are dead

Do the dead frighten you Ser Waymar Royce asked with just the hint of a smile

Gared did not rise to the bait He was an old man past fifty and he had seen the lordlings come and go Dead is dead he said We have no business with the dead

Are they dead Royce asked softly What proof have we

Will saw them Gared said If he says they are dead that’s proof enough for me

Will had known they would drag him into the quarrel sooner or later He wished it had been later rather than sooner My mother told me that dead men sing no songs he put in

My wet nurse said the same thing Will Royce replied Never believe anything you hear at a woman’s tit There are things to be learned even from the dead His voice echoed too loud in the twilit forest

We have a long ride before us Gared pointed out Eight days maybe nine And night is falling
