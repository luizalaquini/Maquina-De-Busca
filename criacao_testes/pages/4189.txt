also
 First well call upon her
But why Come with me to-night and go with
me to-morrow to the surrogates
But she must be consulted at any rate informed
Very well go on
They went up the hill to Bathshebas house When
they stood at the entrance Troy said Wait here a
moment Opening the door he glided inside leaving
the door ajar
Boldwood waited In two minutes a light appeared
in the passage Boldwood then saw that the chain
had been fastened across the door Troy appeared
inside carrying a bedroom candlestick
P 291
What did you think I should break in  said
Boldwood contemptuously
Oh no it is merely my humour to secure things
Will you read this a moment  Ill hold the light
Troy handed a folded newspaper through the slit
between door and doorpost and put the candle close
Thats the paragraph he said placing his finger on
a line
Boldwood looked and read --
MARRIAGES
On the 17th inst at St Ambroses Church Bath
by the Rev G Mincing BA Francis Troy only son
of the late Edward Troy Esq HD of Weatherbury
and sergeant iith Dragoon Guards to Bathsheba only
surviving daughter of the late Mr John Everdene of
Casterbridge
This may be called Fort meeting Feeble hey
Boldwood  said Troy A low gurgle of derisive
laughter followed the words
The paper fell from Boldwoods hands Troy
continued --
Fifty pounds to marry Fanny Good Twenty-+
one pounds not to marry Fanny but Bathsheba Good
Finale  already Bathshebas husband Now Boldwood
yours is the ridiculous fate which always attends inter+
ference between a man and his wife And another
word Bad as I am I am not such a villain as to
make the marriage or misery of any woman a matter
of huckster and sale Fanny has long ago left me
dont know where she is I have searched everywhere
Another word yet You say you love Bathsheba  yet
on the merest apparent evidence you instantly believe
in her dishonour A fig for such love  Now that Ive
taught you a lesson take your money back again
I will not  I will not   said Boldwood in a hiss
Anyhow I wont have it said Troy contemptuously
He wrapped the packet of gold in the notes and threw
the whole into the road
Boldwood shook his clenched fist at him You
juggler of Satan  You black hound  But Ill punish
you yet  mark me Ill punish you yet  
P 292
Another peal of laughter Troy then closed the
door and locked himself in
Throughout the whole of that night Boldwoods dark
downs of Weatherbury like an unhappy Shade in the
Mournful Fields by Acheron

CHAPTER XXXV
AT AN UPPER WINDOW
IT was very early the next morning -- a time of sun and
dew The confused beginnings of many birds songs
spread into the healthy air and the wan blue of the
heaven was here and there coated with thin webs of
incorporeal cloud which were of no efect in obscuring
day All the lights in the scene were yellow as to
colour and all the shadows were attenuated as to form
The creeping plants about the old manor-house were
bowed with rows of heavy water drops which had upon
objects behind them the effect of minute lenses of high
magnifying power
Just before the clock struck five Gabriel Oak and
Coggan passed the village cross and went on together
to the fields They were yet barely in view of their
mistresss house when Oak fancied he saw the opening
of a casement in one of the upper windows The two
men were at this moment partially screened by an elder
bush now beginning to be enriched with black bunches
of fruit and they paused before emerging from its
shade
A handsome man leaned idly from the lattice He
looked east and then west in the manner of one who
makes a first morning survey The man was Sergeant
Troy His red jacket was loosely thrown on but not
buttoned and he had altogether the relaxed bearing of
a soldier taking his ease
Coggan spoke first looking quietly at the window
She has married him   he said
Gabriel had previously beheld the sight and he now
stood with his back turned making no reply
I fancied we should know something to-day con+
tinued Coggan I heard wheels pass my door just
after dark -- you were out somewhereHe glanced
round upon Gabriel Good
