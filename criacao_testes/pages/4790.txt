HOUSE FREY

Powerful wealthy and numerous the Freys are bannermen to House Tully but they have not always been diligent in their duty When Robert Baratheon met Rhaegar Targaryen on the Trident the Freys did not arrive until the battle was done and thereafter Lord Hoster Tully always called Lord Walder the Late Lord Frey It is also said of Walder Frey that he is the only lord in the Seven Kingdoms who could field an army out of his breeches

At the onset of the War of the Five Kings Robb Stark won Lord Walder’s allegiance by pledging to wed one of his daughters or granddaughters Two of Lord Walder’s grandsons were sent to Winterfell to be fostered
