Cersei promised Elia to show you to us The day before we were to sail whilst my mother and your father were closeted together she and Jaime took us down to your nursery Your wet nurse tried to send us off but your sister was having none of that ‘He’s mine’ she said ‘and you’re just a milk cow you can’t tell me what to do Be quiet or I’ll have my father cut your tongue out A cow doesn’t need a tongue only udders’

Her Grace learned charm at an early age said Tyrion amused by the notion of his sister claiming him as hers She’s never been in any rush to claim me since the gods know

Cersei even undid your swaddling clothes to give us a better look the Dornish prince continued You did have one evil eye and some black fuzz on your scalp Perhaps your head was larger than most… but there was no tail no beard neither teeth nor claws and nothing between your legs but a tiny pink cock After all the wonderful whispers Lord Tywin’s Doom turned out to be just a hideous red infant with stunted legs Elia even made the noise that young girls make at the sight of infants I’m sure you’ve heard it The same noise they make over cute kittens and playful puppies I believe she wanted to nurse you herself ugly as you were When I commented that you seemed a poor sort of monster your sister said ‘He killed my mother’ and twisted your little cock so hard I thought she was like to pull it off You shrieked but it was only when your brother Jaime said ‘Leave him be you’re hurting him’ that Cersei let go of you ‘It doesn’t matter’ she told us ‘Everyone says he’s like to die soon He shouldn’t even have lived this long’

The sun was shining bright above them and the day was pleasantly warm for autumn but Tyrion Lannister went cold all over when he heard that My sweet sister He scratched at the scar of his nose and gave the Dornishman a taste of his evil eye Now why would he tell such a tale Is he testing me or simply twisting my cock as Cersei did so he can hear me scream Be sure and tell that story to my father It will delight him as much as it did me The part about my tail especially I did have one but he had it lopped off

Prince Oberyn had a chuckle You’ve grown more amusing since last we met

Yes but I meant to grow taller

While we are speaking of amusement I heard a curious tale from Lord Buckler’s steward He claimed that you had put a tax on women’s privy purses

It is a tax on whoring said Tyrion irritated all over again And it was my bloody father’s notion Only a penny for each ah… act The King’s Hand felt it might help improve the morals of the city And pay for Joffrey’s wedding besides Needless to say as master of coin Tyrion had gotten all the blame for it Bronn said they were calling it the dwarf’s penny in the streets Spread your legs for the Halfman now they were shouting in the brothels and wine sinks if the sellsword could be believed

I will make certain to keep my pouch full of pennies Even a prince must pay his taxes

Why should you need to go whoring He glanced back to where Ellaria Sand rode among the other women Did you tire of your paramour on the road

Never We share too much Prince Oberyn shrugged We have never shared a beautiful blonde woman however and Ellaria is curious Do you know of such a creature

I am a man wedded Though not yet bedded I no longer frequent whores Unless I want to see them hanged

Oberyn abruptly changed the subject It’s said there are to be seventy-seven dishes served at the king’s wedding feast

Are you hungry my prince

I have hungered for a long time Though not for food Pray tell me when will the justice be served

Justice Yes that is why he’s here I should have seen that at once You were close to your sister

As children Elia and I were inseparable much like your own brother and sister

Gods I hope not Wars and weddings have kept us well occupied Prince Oberyn I fear no one has yet had the time to look into murders sixteen years stale dreadful as they were We shall of course just as soon as we may Any help that Dorne might be able to provide to restore the king’s peace would only hasten the beginning of my lord father’s inquiry—

Dwarf said the Red Viper in a tone grown markedly less cordial spare me your Lannister lies Is it sheep you take us for or fools My brother is not a bloodthirsty man but neither has he been asleep for sixteen years Jon Arryn came to Sunspear the year after Robert took the throne and you can be sure that he was questioned closely Him and a hundred more I did not come for some mummer’s show of an inquiry I came for justice for Elia and her children and I will have it Starting with this lummox Gregor Clegane… but not I think ending there Before he dies the Enormity That Rides will tell me whence came his orders please assure your lord father of that He smiled An old septon once claimed I was living proof of the goodness of the gods Do you know why that is Imp

No Tyrion admitted warily

Why if the gods were cruel they would have made me my mother’s firstborn and Doran her third I am a bloodthirsty man you see And it is me you must contend with now not my patient prudent and gouty brother

Tyrion could see the sun shining on the Blackwater Rush half a mile ahead and on the walls and towers and hills of King’s Landing beyond He glanced over his shoulder at the glittering column following them up the kingsroad You speak like a man with a great host at his back he said yet all I see are three hundred Do you spy that city there north of the river

The midden heap you call King’s Landing

That’s the very one

Not only do I see it I believe I smell it now

Then take a good sniff my lord Fill up your nose Half a million people stink more than three hundred you’ll find Do you smell the gold cloaks There are near five thousand of them My father’s own sworn swords must account for another twenty thousand And then there are the roses Roses smell so sweet don’t they Especially when there are so many of them Fifty sixty seventy thousand roses in the city or camped outside it I can’t really say how many are left but there’s more than I care to count anyway

Martell gave a shrug In Dorne of old before we married Daeron it was said that all flowers bow before the sun Should the roses seek to hinder me I’ll gladly trample them underfoot

As you trampled Willas Tyrell

The Dornishman did not react as expected I had a letter from Willas not half a year past We share an interest in fine horseflesh He has never borne me any ill will for what happened in the lists I struck his breastplate clean but his foot caught in a stirrup as he fell and his horse came down on top of him I sent a maester to him afterward but it was all he could do to save the boy’s leg The knee was far past mending If any were to blame it was his fool of a father Willas Tyrell was green as his surcoat and had no business riding in such company The Fat Flower thrust him into tourneys at too tender an age just as he did with the other two He wanted another Leo Longthorn and made himself a cripple

There are those who say Ser Loras is better than Leo Longthorn ever was said Tyrion

Renly’s little rose I doubt that

Doubt it all you wish said Tyrion but Ser Loras has defeated many good knights including my brother Jaime

By defeated you mean unhorsed in tourney Tell me who he’s slain in battle if you mean to frighten me

Ser Robar Royce and Ser Emmon Cuy for two And men say he performed prodigious feats of valor on the Blackwater fighting beside Lord Renly’s ghost

So these same men who saw the prodigious feats saw the ghost as well yes The Dornishman laughed lightly

Tyrion gave him a long look Chataya’s on the Street of Silk has several girls who might suit your needs Dancy has hair the color of honey Marei’s is pale white-gold I would advise you to keep one or the other by your side at all times my lord

At all times Prince Oberyn lifted a thin black eyebrow And why is that my good Imp

You want to die with a breast in hand you said Tyrion cantered on ahead to where the ferry barges waited on the south bank of the Blackwater He had suffered all he meant to suffer of what passed for Dornish wit Father should have sent Joffrey after all He could have asked Prince Oberyn if he knew how a Dornishman differed from a cowflop That made him grin despite himself He would have to make a point of being on hand when the Red Viper was presented to the king





Arya


The man on the roof was the first to die He was crouched down by the chimney two hundred yards away no more than a vague shadow in the predawn gloom but as the sky began to lighten he stirred stretched and stood Anguy’s arrow took him in the chest He tumbled bonelessly down the steep slate pitch and fell in front of the septry door

The Mummers had posted two guards there but their torch left them night blind and the outlaws had crept in close Kyle and Notch let fly together One man went down with an arrow through his throat the other through his belly The second man dropped the torch and the flames licked up at him He screamed as his clothes took fire and that was the end of stealth Thoros gave a shout and the outlaws attacked in earnest

Arya watched from atop her horse on the crest of the wooded ridge that overlooked the septry mill brewhouse and stables and the desolation of weeds burnt trees and mud that surrounded them The trees were mostly bare now and the few withered brown leaves that still clung to the branches did little to obstruct her view Lord Beric had left Beardless Dick and Mudge to guard them Arya hated being left behind like she was some stupid child but at least Gendry had been kept back as well She knew better than to try and argue This was battle and in battle you had to obey

The eastern horizon glowed gold and pink and overhead a half moon peeked out through low scuttling clouds The wind blew cold and Arya could hear the rush of water and the creak of the mill’s great wooden waterwheel There was a smell of rain in the dawn air but no drops were falling yet Flaming arrows flew through the morning mists trailing pale ribbons of fire and thudded into the wooden walls of the septry A few smashed through shuttered windows and soon enough thin tendrils of smoke were rising between the broken shutters

Two Mummers came bursting from the septry side by side axes in their hands Anguy and the other archers were waiting One axeman died at once The other managed to duck so the shaft ripped through his shoulder He staggered on till two more arrows found him so quickly it was hard to say which had struck first The long shafts punched through his breastplate as if it had been made of silk instead of steel He fell heavily Anguy had arrows tipped with bodkins as well as broadheads A bodkin could pierce even heavy plate I’m going to learn to shoot a bow Arya thought She loved sword fighting but she could see how arrows were good too

Flames were creeping up the west wall of the septry and thick smoke poured through a broken window A Myrish crossbowman poked his head out a different window got off a bolt and ducked down to rewind She could hear fighting from the stables as well shouts well mingled with the screams of horses and the clang of steel Kill them all she thought fiercely She bit her lip so hard she tasted blood Kill every single one

The crossbowman appeared again but no sooner had he loosed than three arrows hissed past his head One rattled off his helm He vanished bow and all Arya could see flames in several of the second-story windows Between the smoke and the morning mists the air was a haze of blowing black and white Anguy and the other bowmen were creeping closer the better to find targets

Then the septry erupted the Mummers boiling out like angry ants Two Ibbenese rushed through the door with shaggy brown shields held high before them and behind them came a Dothraki with a great curved arakh and bells in his braid and behind him three Volantene sellswords covered with fierce tattoos Others were climbing out windows and leaping to the ground Arya saw a man take an arrow through the chest with one leg across a windowsill and heard his scream as he fell The smoke was thickening Quarrels and arrows sped back and forth Watty fell with a grunt his bow slipping from his hand Kyle was trying to nock another shaft to his string when a man in black mail flung a spear through his belly She heard Lord Beric shout From out of the ditches and trees the rest of his band came pouring steel in hand Arya saw Lem’s bright yellow cloak flapping behind him as he rode down the man who’d killed Kyle Thoros and Lord Beric were everywhere their swords swirling fire The red priest hacked at a hide shield until it flew to pieces while his horse kicked the man in the face A Dothraki screamed and charged the lightning lord and the flaming sword leapt out to meet his arakh The blades kissed and spun and kissed again Then the Dothraki’s hair was ablaze and a moment later he was dead She spied Ned too fighting at the lightning lord’s side It’s not fair he’s only a little older than me they should have let me fight
