Husband had stepped outside but at her shout he hurried back The duck’s hung What is it now woman

Wash these vegetables she commanded The rest of you sit down while I start the rabbits The boy will bring you drink She looked down her long nose at Arya and Hot Pie I am not in the habit of serving ale to children but the cider’s run out there’s no cows for milk and the river water tastes of war with all the dead men drifting downstream If I served you a cup of soup full of dead flies would you drink it

Arry would said Hot Pie I mean Squab

So would Lem offered Anguy with a sly smile

Never you mind about Lem Sharna said It’s ale for all She swept off toward the kitchen

Anguy and Tom Sevenstrings took the table near the hearth while Lem was hanging his big yellow cloak on a peg Hot Pie plopped down heavily on a bench at the table by the door and Arya wedged herself in beside him

Tom unslung his harp A lonely inn on a forest road he sang slowly picking out a tune to go with the words The innkeep’s wife was plain as a toad

Shut up with that now or we won’t be getting no rabbit Lem warned him You know how she is

Arya leaned close to Hot Pie Can you sail a boat she asked Before he could answer a thickset boy of fifteen or sixteen appeared with tankards of ale Hot Pie took his reverently in both hands and when he sipped he smiled wider than Arya had ever seen him smile Ale he whispered and rabbit

Well here’s to His Grace Anguy the Archer called out cheerfully lifting a toast Seven save the king

All twelve o’them Lem Lemoncloak muttered He drank and wiped the foam from his mouth with the back of his hand

Husband came bustling in through the front door with an apron full of washed vegetables There’s strange horses in the stable he announced as if they hadn’t known

Aye said Tom setting the woodharp aside and better horses than the three you gave away

Husband dropped the vegetables on a table annoyed I never gave them away I sold them for a good price and got us a skiff as well Anyways you lot were supposed to get them back

I knew they were outlaws Arya thought listening Her hand went under the table to touch the hilt of her dagger and make sure it was still there If they try to rob us they’ll be sorry

They never came our way said Lem

Well I sent them You must have been drunk or asleep

Us Drunk Tom drank a long draught of ale Never

You could have taken them yourself Lem told Husband

What with only the boy here I told you twice the old woman was up to Lambswold helping that Fern birth her babe And like as not it was one o’ you planted the bastard in the poor girl’s belly He gave Tom a sour look You I’d wager with that harp o’ yours singing all them sad songs just to get poor Fern out of her smallclothes

If a song makes a maid want to slip off her clothes and feel the good warm sun kiss her skin why is that the singer’s fault asked Tom And ’twas Anguy she fancied besides ‘Can I touch your bow’ I heard her ask him ‘Ooohh it feels so smooth and hard Could I give it a little pull do you think’

Husband snorted You and Anguy makes no matter which You’re as much to blame as me for them horses They was three you know What can one man do against three

Three said Lem scornfully but one a woman and t’other in chains you said so yourself

Husband made a face A big woman dressed like a man And the one in chains… I didn’t fancy the look of his eyes

Anguy smiled over his ale When I don’t fancy a man’s eyes I put an arrow through one

Arya remembered the shaft that had brushed by her ear She wished she knew how to shoot arrows

Husband was not impressed You be quiet when your elders are talking Drink your ale and mind your tongue or I’ll have the old woman take a spoon to you
