You threatened to geld me Joffrey said shrilly

I did Your Grace said Tyrion but only because I envied your royal manhood Mine own is so small and stunted His face twisted into a leer And if you take my tongue you will leave me no way at all to pleasure this sweet wife you gave me

Laughter burst from the lips of Ser Osmund Kettleblack Someone else sniggered But Joff did not laugh nor Lord Tywin Your Grace he said my son is drunk you can see that

I am the Imp confessed but not so drunk that I cannot attend to my own bedding He hopped down from the dais and grabbed Sansa roughly Come wife time to smash your portcullis I want to play come-into-the-castle

Red-faced Sansa went with him from the Small Hall What choice do I have Tyrion waddled when he walked especially when he walked as quickly as he did now The gods were merciful and neither Joffrey nor any of the others moved to follow

For their wedding night they had been granted the use of an airy bedchamber high in the Tower of the Hand Tyrion kicked the door shut behind them There is a flagon of good Arbor gold on the sideboard Sansa Will you be so kind as to pour me a cup

Is that wise my lord

Nothing was ever wiser I am not truly drunk you see But I mean to be

Sansa filled a goblet for each of them It will be easier if I am drunk as well She sat on the edge of the great curtained bed and drained half her cup in three long swallows No doubt it was very fine wine but she was too nervous to taste it It made her head swim Would you have me undress my lord

Tyrion He cocked his head My name is Tyrion Sansa

Tyrion My lord Should I take off my gown or do you want to undress me She took another swallow of wine

The Imp turned away from her The first time I wed there was us and a drunken septon and some pigs to bear witness We ate one of our witnesses at our wedding feast Tysha fed me crackling and I licked the grease off her fingers and we were laughing when we fell into bed

You were wed before I    I had forgotten

You did not forget You never knew

Who was she my lord Sansa was curious despite herself

Lady Tysha His mouth twisted Of House Silverfist Their arms have one gold coin and a hundred silver upon a bloody sheet Ours was a very short marriage    as befits a very short man I suppose

Sansa stared down at her hands and said nothing

How old are you Sansa asked Tyrion after a moment

Thirteen she said when the moon turns

Gods have mercy The dwarf took another swallow of wine Well talk won’t make you older Shall we get on with this my lady If it please you

It will please me to please my lord husband

That seemed to anger him You hide behind courtesy as if it were a castle wall

Courtesy is a lady’s armor Sansa said Her septa had always told her that

I am your husband You can take off your armor now

And my clothing

That too He waved his wine cup at her My lord father has commanded me to consummate this marriage

Her hands trembled as she began fumbling at her clothes She had ten thumbs instead of fingers and all of them were broken Yet somehow she managed the laces and buttons and her cloak and gown and girdle and undersilk slid to the floor until finally she was stepping out of her smallclothes Gooseprickles covered her arms and legs She kept her eyes on the floor too shy to look at him but when she was done she glanced up and found him staring There was hunger in his green eye it seemed to her and fury in the black Sansa did not know which scared her more

You’re a child he said

She covered her breasts with her hands I’ve flowered

A child he repeated but I want you Does that frighten you Sansa

Yes

Me as well I know I am ugly—

No my—

He pushed himself to his feet Don’t lie Sansa I am malformed scarred and small but    she could see him groping    abed when the candles are blown out I am made no worse than other men In the dark I am the Knight of Flowers He took a draught of wine I am generous Loyal to those who are loyal to me I’ve proven I’m no craven And I am cleverer than most surely wits count for something I can even be kind Kindness is not a habit with us Lannisters I fear but I know I have some somewhere I could be    I could be good to you

He is as frightened as I am Sansa realized Perhaps that should have made her feel more kindly toward him but it did not All she felt was pity and pity was death to desire He was looking at her waiting for her to say something but all her words had withered She could only stand there trembling

When he finally realized that she had no answer for him Tyrion Lannister drained the last of his wine I understand he said bitterly Get in the bed Sansa We need to do our duty

She climbed onto the featherbed conscious of his stare A scented beeswax candle burned on the bedside table and rose petals had been strewn between the sheets She had started to pull up a blanket to cover herself when she heard him say No

The cold made her shiver but she obeyed Her eyes closed and she waited After a moment she heard the sound of her husband pulling off his boots and the rustle of clothing as he undressed himself When he hopped up on the bed and put his hand on her breast Sansa could not help but shudder She lay with her eyes closed every muscle tense dreading what might come next Would he touch her again Kiss her Should she open her legs for him now She did not know what was expected of her

Sansa The hand was gone Open your eyes

She had promised to obey she opened her eyes He was sitting by her feet naked Where his legs joined his man’s staff poked up stiff and hard from a thicket of coarse yellow hair but it was the only thing about him that was straight

My lady Tyrion said you are lovely make no mistake but    I cannot do this My father be damned We will wait The turn of a moon a year a season however long it takes Until you have come to know me better and perhaps to trust me a little His smile might have been meant to be reassuring but without a nose it only made him look more grotesque and sinister

Look at him Sansa told herself look at your husband at all of him Septa Mordane said all men are beautiful find his beauty try She stared at the stunted legs the swollen brutish brow the green eye and the black one the raw stump of his nose and crooked pink scar the coarse tangle of black and gold hair that passed for his beard Even his manhood was ugly thick and veined with a bulbous purple head This is not right this is not fair how have I sinned that the gods would do this to me how

On my honor as a Lannister the Imp said I will not touch you until you want me to

It took all the courage that was in her to look in those mismatched eyes and say And if I never want you to my lord

His mouth jerked as if she had slapped him Never

Her neck was so tight she could scarcely nod

Why he said that is why the gods made whores for imps like me He closed his short blunt fingers into a fist and climbed down off the bed
