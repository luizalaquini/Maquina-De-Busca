Ned’s eyes flicked to the king’s letter on the table beside him its seal unbroken And how is it you know that my lord

Varys hinted as much Littlefinger said and you have just confirmed it

Ned’s mouth twisted in anger Damn Varys and his little birds Catelyn spoke truly the man has some black art I do not trust him

Excellent You’re learning Littlefinger leaned forward Yet I’ll wager you did not drag me here in the black of night to discuss the eunuch

No Ned admitted I know the secret Jon Arryn was murdered to protect Robert will leave no trueborn son behind him Joffrey and Tommen are Jaime Lannister’s bastards born of his incestuous union with the queen

Littlefinger lifted an eyebrow Shocking he said in a tone that suggested he was not shocked at all The girl as well No doubt So when the king dies…

The throne by rights passes to Lord Stannis the elder of Robert’s two brothers

Lord Petyr stroked his pointed beard as he considered the matter So it would seem Unless…

Unless my lord There is no seeming to this Stannis is the heir Nothing can change that

Stannis cannot take the throne without your help If you’re wise you’ll make certain Joffrey succeeds

Ned gave him a stony stare Have you no shred of honor

Oh a shred surely Littlefinger replied negligently Hear me out Stannis is no friend of yours nor of mine Even his brothers can scarcely stomach him The man is iron hard and unyielding He’ll give us a new Hand and a new council for a certainty No doubt he’ll thank you for handing him the crown but he won’t love you for it And his ascent will mean war Stannis cannot rest easy on the throne until Cersei and her bastards are dead Do you think Lord Tywin will sit idly while his daughter’s head is measured for a spike Casterly Rock will rise and not alone Robert found it in him to pardon men who served King Aerys so long as they did him fealty Stannis is less forgiving He will not have forgotten the siege of Storm’s End and the Lords Tyrell and Redwyne dare not Every man who fought beneath the dragon banner or rose with Balon Greyjoy will have good cause to fear Seat Stannis on the Iron Throne and I promise you the realm will bleed

Now look at the other side of the coin Joffrey is but twelve and Robert gave you the regency my lord You are the Hand of the King and Protector of the Realm The power is yours Lord Stark All you need do is reach out and take it Make your peace with the Lannisters Release the Imp Wed Joffrey to your Sansa Wed your younger girl to Prince Tommen and your heir to Myrcella It will be four years before Joffrey comes of age By then he will look to you as a second father and if not well… four years is a good long while my lord Long enough to dispose of Lord Stannis Then should Joffrey prove troublesome we can reveal his little secret and put Lord Renly on the throne

We Ned repeated

Littlefinger gave a shrug You’ll need someone to share your burdens I assure you my price would be modest

Your price Ned’s voice was ice Lord Baelish what you suggest is treason

Only if we lose

You forget Ned told him You forget Jon Arryn You forget Jory Cassel And you forget this He drew the dagger and laid it on the table between them a length of dragonbone and Valyrian steel as sharp as the difference between right and wrong between true and false between life and death They sent a man to cut my son’s throat Lord Baelish

Littlefinger sighed I fear I did forget my lord Pray forgive me For a moment I did not remember that I was talking to a Stark His mouth quirked So it will be Stannis and war

It is not a choice Stannis is the heir

Far be it from me to dispute the Lord Protector What would you have of me then Not my wisdom for a certainty

I shall do my best to forget your… wisdom Ned said with distaste I called you here to ask for the help you promised Catelyn This is a perilous hour for all of us Robert has named me Protector true enough but in the eyes of the world Joffrey is still his son and heir The queen has a dozen knights and a hundred men-at-arms who will do whatever she commands… enough to overwhelm what remains of my own household guard And for all I know her brother Jaime may be riding for King’s Landing even as we speak with a Lannister host at his back

And you without an army Littlefinger toyed with the dagger on the table turning it slowly with a finger There is small love lost between Lord Renly and the Lannisters Bronze Yohn Royce Ser Balon Swann Ser Loras Lady Tanda the Redwyne twins… each of them has a retinue of knights and sworn swords here at court

Renly has thirty men in his personal guard the rest even fewer It is not enough even if I could be certain that all of them will choose to give me their allegiance I must have the gold cloaks The City Watch is two thousand strong sworn to defend the castle the city and the king’s peace

Ah but when the queen proclaims one king and the Hand another whose peace do they protect Lord Petyr flicked at the dagger with his finger setting it spinning in place Round and round it went wobbling as it turned When at last it slowed to a stop the blade pointed at Littlefinger Why there’s your answer he said smiling They follow the man who pays them He leaned back and looked Ned full in the face his grey-green eyes bright with mockery You wear your honor like a suit of armor Stark You think it keeps you safe but all it does is weigh you down and make it hard for you to move Look at you now You know why you summoned me here You know what you want to ask me to do You know it has to be done… but it’s not honorable so the words stick in your throat

Ned’s neck was rigid with tension For a moment he was so angry that he did not trust himself to speak

Littlefinger laughed I ought to make you say it but that would be cruel… so have no fear my good lord For the sake of the love I bear for Catelyn I will go to Janos Slynt this very hour and make certain that the City Watch is yours Six thousand gold pieces should do it A third for the Commander a third for the officers a third for the men We might be able to buy them for half that much but I prefer not to take chances Smiling he plucked up the dagger and offered it to Ned hilt first





JON

Jon was breaking his fast on applecakes and blood sausage when Samwell Tarly plopped himself down on the bench I’ve been summoned to the sept Sam said in an excited whisper They’re passing me out of training I’m to be made a brother with the rest of you Can you believe it

No truly

Truly I’m to assist Maester Aemon with the library and the birds He needs someone who can read and write letters

You’ll do well at that Jon said smiling

Sam glanced about anxiously Is it time to go I shouldn’t be late they might change their minds He was fairly bouncing as they crossed the weed-strewn courtyard The day was warm and sunny Rivulets of water trickled down the sides of the Wall so the ice seemed to sparkle and shine

Inside the sept the great crystal caught the morning light as it streamed through the south-facing window and spread it in a rainbow on the altar Pyp’s mouth dropped open when he caught sight of Sam and Toad poked Grenn in the ribs but no one dared say a word Septon Celladar was swinging a censer filling the air with fragrant incense that reminded Jon of Lady Stark’s little sept in Winterfell For once the septon seemed sober

The high officers arrived in a body Maester Aemon leaning on Clydas Ser Alliser cold-eyed and grim Lord Commander Mormont resplendent in a black wool doublet with silvered bearclaw fastenings Behind them came the senior members of the three orders red-faced Bowen Marsh the Lord Steward First Builder Othell Yarwyck and Ser Jaremy Rykker who commanded the rangers in the absence of Benjen Stark

Mormont stood before the altar the rainbow shining on his broad bald head You came to us outlaws he began poachers rapers debtors killers and thieves You came to us children You came to us alone in chains with neither friends nor honor You came to us rich and you came to us poor Some of you bear the names of proud houses Others have only bastards’ names or no names at all It makes no matter All that is past now On the Wall we are all one house

At evenfall as the sun sets and we face the gathering night you shall take your vows From that moment you will be a Sworn Brother of the Night’s Watch Your crimes will be washed away your debts forgiven So too you must wash away your former loyalties put aside your grudges forget old wrongs and old loves alike Here you begin anew

A man of the Night’s Watch lives his life for the realm Not for a king nor a lord nor the honor of this house or that house neither for gold nor glory nor a woman’s love but for the realm and all the people in it A man of the Night’s Watch takes no wife and fathers no sons Our wife is duty Our mistress is honor And you are the only sons we shall ever know

You have learned the words of the vow Think carefully before you say them for once you have taken the black there is no turning back The penalty for desertion is death The Old Bear paused for a moment before he said Are there any among you who wish to leave our company If so go now and no one shall think the less of you

No one moved

Well and good said Mormont You may take your vows here at evenfall before Septon Celladar and the first of your order Do any of you keep to the old gods

Jon stood I do my lord

I expect you will want to say your words before a heart tree as your uncle did Mormont said

Yes my lord Jon said The gods of the sept had nothing to do with him the blood of the First Men flowed in the veins of the Starks

He heard Grenn whispering behind him There’s no godswood here Is there I never saw a godswood

You wouldn’t see a herd of aurochs until they trampled you into the snow Pyp whispered back

I would so Grenn insisted I’d see them a long way off

Mormont himself confirmed Grenn’s doubts Castle Black has no need of a godswood Beyond the Wall the haunted forest stands as it stood in the Dawn Age long before the Andals brought the Seven across the narrow sea You will find a grove of weirwoods half a league from this spot and mayhap your gods as well
