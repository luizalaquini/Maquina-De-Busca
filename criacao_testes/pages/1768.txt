Oh she cried out in affright pressing her hand to
her side  Have you run me through  -- no you have
not Whatever have you done
I have not touched you said Troy quietly It
was mere sleight of hand The sword passed behind
you Now you are not afraid are you  Because if
you are l cant perform I give my word that l will
not only not hurt you but not once touch you
I dont think I am afraid You are quite sure you
will not hurt me 
Quite sure
Is the sWord very sharp 
O no -- only stand as still as a statue Now 
In an instant the atmosphere was transformed to
Bathshebas eyes Beams of light caught from the low
suns rays above around in front of her well-nigh shut
out earth and heaven -- all emitted in the marvellous
evolutions of Troys reflecting blade which seemed
everywhere at once and yet nowherre specially These
circling gleams were accompanied by a keen rush that
was almost a whistling -- also springing
P 240
from all sides of
her at once In short she was enclosed in a firmament
of light and of sharp hisses resembling a sky-full of
meteors close at hand
Never since the broadsword became the national
weapon had there been more dexterity shown in its
management than by the hands of Sergeant Troy and
never had he been in such splendid temper for the
performance as now in the evening sunshine among the
ferns with Bathsheba It may safely be asserted with
respect to the closeness of his cuts that had it been
possible for the edge of the sword to leave in the air a
permanent substance wherever it flew past the space
left untouched would have been almost a mould of
Bathshebas figure
Behind the luminous streams of this aurora militaris
she could see the hue of Troys sword arm spread in a
scarlet haze over the space covered by its motions like
a twanged harpstring and behind all Troy himself
mostly facing her sometimes to show the rear cuts
half turned away his eye nevertheless always keenly
measuring her breadth and outline and his lips tightly
closed in sustained effort Next his movements lapsed
slower and she could see them individually The
hissing of the sword had ceased and he stopped
entirely
That outer loose lock of hair wants tidying he
said before she had moved or spoken Wait Ill do
it for you
An arc of silver shone on her right side the sword
had descended The lock droped to the ground
Bravely borne said Troy You didnt flinch a
shades thickness Wonderful in a woman
It was because I didnt expect it O you have
spoilt my hair
Only once more
No -- no I am afraid of you -- indeed I am  she
cried
I wont touch you at all -- not even your hair I
am only going to kill that caterpillar settling on you
Now still
It appeared that a caterpillar had come from the
fern and chosen the front of her bodice as his resting
place She saw the point glisten towards her bosom
and seemingly enter it Bathsheba closed her eyes in
the full persuasion that she was
P 241
killed at last How+
ever feeling just as usual she opened them again
There it is look said the sargeant holding his
sword before her eyes
The caterpillar was spitted upon its point
Why it is magic said Bathsheba amazed
O no -- dexterity I merely gave point to your
bosom where the caterpillar was and instead of running
you through checked the extension a thousandth of an
inch short of your surface
But how could you chop off a curl of my hair with
a sword that has no edge
THE HOLLOW AMID THE FERNS
No edge  This sword will shave like a razor
Look here
He touched the palm of his hand with the blade
and then lifting it showed her a thin shaving of scarf+
skin dangling therefrom
 But you said before beginning that it was blunt and
couldnt cut me 
That was to get you to stand still and so make sure
of your safety The risk of injuring you through your
moving was too great not to force me to tell you a
fib to escape it
She shuddered I have been within an inch of my
life and didnt know it 
More precisely speaking you have been within half
an inch of being pared alive two hundred and ninety-five
tinies
 Cruel cruel tis of you  
 You have been perfectly safe nevertheless My
