earlier On the other side of the scene stood Gabriel
His eyes too were fixed on the tomb and her arrival
having been noiseless she had not as yet attracted his
attention Bathsheba did not at once perceive that the
grand tomb and the disturbed grave were Fannys and
she looked on both sides and around for some humbler
mound

earthed up and clodded in the usual way Then
her eye followed Oaks and she read the words with
which the inscription opened  --
Erected by Francis Troy in Beloved Memory of
Fanny Robin
Oak saw her and his first act was to gaze inquiringly
and learn how she received this knowledge of the
authorship of the work which to himself had caused
considerable astonishment But such discoveries did
not much affect her now Emotional convulsions seemed
to have become the commonplaces of her history and
she bade him good morning and asked him to fill in
the hole with the spade which was standing by Whilst
Oak was doing as she desired Bathsheba collected the
flowers and began planting them with that sympathetic
manipulation of roots and leaves which is so conspicuous
in a womans gardening and which flowers seem to
understand and thrive upon She requested Oak to
get the churchwardens to turn the leadwork at the
mouth of the gurgoyle that hung gaping down upon
them that by this means the stream might be directed
sideways and a repetition of the accident prevented
Finally with the superfluous magnanimity of a woman
whose narrower instincts have brought down bitterness
upon her instead of love she wiped the mud spots from
the tomb as if she rather liked its words than otherwise

ADVENTURES BY THE SHORE
TROY wandered along towards the south A composite
feeling made up of disgust with the to him humdrum
tediousness of a farmers life gloomly images of her who
lay in the churchyard remorse and a general averseness
to his wifes society impelled him to seek a home in any
place on earth save Weatherbury The sad accessories
of Fannys end confronted him as vivid pictures which
threatened to be indelible and made life in Bathshebas
house intolerable At three in the afternoon he found
himself at the foot of a slope more than a mile in length
which ran to the ridge of a range of hills lying parallel
with the shore and forming a monotonous barrier between
the basin of cultivated country inland and the wilder
scenery of the coast Up the hill stretched a road
nearly straight and perfectly white the two sides
approaching each other in a gradual taper till they
met the sky at the top about two miles off Through+
out the length of this narrow and irksome inclined plane
not a sign of life was visible on this garish afternoon
Troy toiled up the road with a languor and depression
greater than any he had experienced for many a day
and year before The air was warm and muggy and
the top seemed to recede as he approached
At last he reached the summit and a wide and
novel prospect burst upon him with an effect almost like
that of the Pacific upon Balboas gaze The broad
steely sea marked only by faint lines which had a
semblance of being etched thereon to a degree not deep
enough to disturb its general evenness stretched the
whole width of his front and round to the right where
near the town and port of Budmouth the sun bristled
down upon it and banished all colour to substitute in
its place a clear oily polish Nothing moved in sky
land or sea except a frill of milkwhite foam along the
nearer angles of the
P 383
shore shreds of which licked the
contiguous stones like tongues
He descended and came to a small basin of sea
enclosed by the cliffs Troys nature freshened within
him  he thought he would rest and bathe here before
going farther He undressed and plunged in Inside
the cove the water was uninteresting to a swimmer
being smooth as a pond and to get a little of the ocean
swell Troy presently swam between the two projecting
spurs of rock which formed the pillars of Hercules to
this miniature Mediterranean Unfortunately for Troy
a current unknown to him existed outside which un+
important to craft of any burden was awkward for a
swimmer who might be taken in it unawares Troy
found himself carried to the left and then round in a
swoop out to sea
He now recollected the place and its sinister
character Many bathers had there prayed for a dry
death from time to time and like Gonzalo also had
been unanswered  and Troy began to deem it possible
that he might be added to their number Not a boat
of any kind was at present within sight but far in the
distance Budmouth lay upon the sea as it were quietly
regarding his efforts and beside the town the harbour
showed its position by a dim meshwork of ropes and
spars After welinigh exhausting himself in attempts
to get back to the mouth of the cove in his weakness
