I have need of every man who knows which end of the spear to stab into the wildlings

The pointy end Jon had told his little sister something like that once he remembered

Noye rubbed the bristle on his chin Might be you’ll do We’ll put you on a tower with a longbow but if you bloody well fall off don’t come crying to me

He could see the kingsroad wending its way south through stony brown fields and over windswept hills The Magnar would be coming up that road before the day was done his Thenns marching behind him with axes and spears in their hands and their bronze-and-leather shields on their backs Grigg the Goat Quort Big Boil and the rest will be coming as well And Ygritte The wildlings had never been his friends he had not allowed them to be his friends but her…

He could feel the throb of pain where her arrow had gone through the meat and muscle of his thigh He remembered the old man’s eyes too and the black blood rushing from his throat as the storm cracked overhead But he remembered the grotto best of all the look of her naked in the torchlight the taste of her mouth when it opened under his Ygritte stay away Go south and raid go hide in one of those roundtowers you liked so well You’ll find nothing here but death

Across the yard one of the bowmen on the roof of the old Flint Barracks had unlaced his breeches and was pissing through a crenel Mully he knew from the man’s greasy orange hair Men in black cloaks were visible on other roofs and tower tops as well though nine of every ten happened to be made of straw The scarecrow sentinels Donal Noye called them Only we’re the crows Jon mused and most of us were scared enough

Whatever you called them the straw soldiers had been Maester Aemon’s notion They had more breeches and jerkins and tunics in the storerooms than they’d had men to fill them so why not stuff some with straw drape a cloak around their shoulders and set them to standing watches Noye had placed them on every tower and in half the windows Some were even clutching spears or had crossbows cocked under their arms The hope was that the Thenns would see them from afar and decide that Castle Black was too well defended to attack

Jon had six scarecrows sharing the roof of the King’s Tower with him along with two actual breathing brothers Deaf Dick Follard sat in a crenel methodically cleaning and oiling the mechanism of his crossbow to make sure the wheel turned smoothly while the Oldtown boy wandered restlessly around the parapets fussing with the clothes on straw men Maybe he thinks they will fight better if they’re posed just right Or maybe this waiting is fraying his nerves the way it’s fraying mine

The boy claimed to be eighteen older than Jon but he was green as summer grass for all that Satin they called him even in the wool and mail and boiled leather of the Night’s Watch the name he’d gotten in the brothel where he’d been born and raised He was pretty as a girl with his dark eyes soft skin and raven’s ringlets Half a year at Castle Black had toughened up his hands however and Noye said he was passable with a crossbow Whether he had the courage to face what was coming though…

Jon used the crutch to limp across the tower top The King’s Tower was not the castle’s tallest—the high slim crumbling Lance held that honor though Othell Yarwyck had been heard to say it might topple any day Nor was the King’s Tower strongest—the Tower of Guards beside the kingsroad would be a tougher nut to crack But it was tall enough strong enough and well placed beside the Wall overlooking the gate and the foot of the wooden stair

The first time he had seen Castle Black with his own eyes Jon had wondered why anyone would be so foolish as to build a castle without walls How could it be defended

It can’t his uncle told him That is the point The Night’s Watch is pledged to take no part in the quarrels of the realm Yet over the centuries certain Lords Commander more proud than wise forgot their vows and near destroyed us all with their ambitions Lord Commander Runcel Hightower tried to bequeathe the Watch to his bastard son Lord Commander Rodrik Flint thought to make himself King-beyond-the-Wall Tristan Mudd Mad Marq Rankenfell Robin Hill… did you know that six hundred years ago the commanders at Snowgate and the Nightfort went to war against each other And when the Lord Commander tried to stop them they joined forces to murder him The Stark in Winterfell had to take a hand… and both their heads Which he did easily because their strongholds were not defensible The Night’s Watch had nine hundred and ninety-six Lords Commander before Jeor Mormont most of them men of courage and honor… but we have had cowards and fools as well our tyrants and our madmen We survive because the lords and kings of the Seven Kingdoms know that we pose no threat to them no matter who should lead us Our only foes are to the north and to the north we have the Wall

Only now those foes have gotten past the Wall to come up from the south Jon reflected and the lords and kings of the Seven Kingdoms have forgotten us We are caught between the hammer and the anvil Without a wall Castle Black could not be held Donal Noye knew that as well as any The castle does them no good the armorer told his little garrison Kitchens common hall stables even the towers… let them take it all We’ll empty the armory and move what stores we can to the top of the Wall and make our stand around the gate

So Castle Black had a wall of sorts at last a crescent-shaped barricade ten feet high made of stores casks of nails and barrels of salt mutton crates bales of black broadcloth stacked logs sawn timbers fire-hardened stakes and sacks and sacks of grain The crude rampart enclosed the two things most worth defending the gate to the north and the foot of the great wooden switchback stair that clawed and climbed its way up the face of the Wall like a drunken thunderbolt supported by wooden beams as big as tree trunks driven deep into the ice

The last few moles were still making the long climb Jon saw urged on by his brothers Grenn was carrying a little boy in his arms while Pyp two flights below let an old man lean upon his shoulder The oldest villagers still waited below for the cage to make its way back down to them He saw a mother pulling along two children one on either hand as an older boy ran past her up the steps Two hundred feet above them Sky Blue Su and Lady Meliana who was no lady all her friends agreed stood on a landing looking south They had a better view of the smoke than he did no doubt Jon wondered about the villagers who had chosen not to flee There were always a few too stubborn or too stupid or too brave to run a few who preferred to fight or hide or bend the knee Maybe the Thenns would spare them

The thing to do would be to take the attack to them he thought With fifty rangers well mounted we could cut them apart on the road They did not have fifty rangers though nor half as many horses The garrison had not returned and there was no way to know just where they were or even whether the riders that Noye had sent out had reached them

We are the garrison Jon told himself and look at us The brothers Bowen Marsh had left behind were old men cripples and green boys just as Donal Noye had warned him He could see some wrestling barrels up the steps others on the barricade stout old Kegs as slow as ever Spare Boot hopping along briskly on his carved wooden leg half-mad Easy who fancied himself Florian the Fool reborn Dornish Dilly Red Alyn of the Rosewood Young Henly well past fifty Old Henly well past seventy Hairy Hal Spotted Pate of Maidenpool A couple of them saw Jon looking down from atop the King’s Tower and waved up at him Others turned away They still think me a turncloak That was a bitter draft to drink but Jon could not blame them He was a bastard after all Everyone knew that bastards were wanton and treacherous by nature having been born of lust and deceit And he had made as many enemies as friends at Castle Black… Rast for one Jon had once threatened to have Ghost rip his throat out unless he stopped tormenting Samwell Tarly and Rast did not forget things like that He was raking dry leaves into piles under the stairs just now but every so often he stopped long enough to give Jon a nasty look

No Donal Noye roared at three of the Mole’s Town men down below The pitch goes to the hoist the oil up the steps crossbow bolts to the fourth fifth and sixth landings spears to first and second Stack the lard under the stair yes there behind the planks The casks of meat are for the barricade Now you poxy plow pushers NOW

He has a lord’s voice Jon thought His father had always said that in battle a captain’s lungs were as important as his sword arm It does not matter how brave or brilliant a man is if his commands cannot be heard Lord Eddard told his sons so Robb and he used to climb the towers of Winterfell to shout at each other across the yard Donal Noye could have drowned out both of them The moles all went in terror of him and rightfully so since he was always threatening to rip their heads off

Three-quarters of the village had taken Jon’s warning to heart and come to Castle Black for refuge Noye had decreed that every man still spry enough to hold a spear or swing an axe would help defend the barricade else they could damn well go home and take their chances with the Thenns He had emptied the armory to put good steel in their hands big double-bladed axes razor-sharp daggers longswords maces spiked morningstars Clad in studded leather jerkins and mail hauberks with greaves for their legs and gorgets to keep their heads on their shoulders a few of them even looked like soldiers In a bad light If you squint

Noye had put the women and children to work as well Those too young to fight would carry water and tend the fires the Mole’s Town midwife would assist Clydas and Maester Aemon with any wounded and Three-Finger Hobb suddenly had more spit boys kettle stirrers and onion choppers than he knew what to do with Two of the whores had even offered to fight and had shown enough skill with the crossbow to be given a place on the steps forty feet up

It’s cold Satin stood with his hands tucked into his armpits under his cloak His cheeks were bright red

Jon made himself smile The Frostfangs are cold This is a brisk autumn day

I hope I never see the Frostfangs then I knew a girl in Oldtown who liked to ice her wine That’s the best place for ice I think In wine Satin glanced south frowned You think the scarecrow sentinels scared them off my lord

We can hope It was possible Jon supposed… but more likely the wildlings had simply paused for a bit of rape and plunder in Mole’s Town Or maybe Styr was waiting for nightfall to move up under cover of darkness

Midday came and went with still no sign of Thenns on the kingsroad Jon heard footsteps inside the tower though and Owen the Oaf popped up out of the trapdoor red-faced from the climb He had a basket of buns under one arm a wheel of cheese under the other a bag of onions dangling from one hand Hobb said to feed you in case you’re stuck up here awhile

That or for our last meal Thank him for us Owen
