Last night I was she admitted But now the sun’s up She pushed her hair aside to bare her neck and knelt before him Strike hard and true crow or I’ll come back and haunt you

Longclaw was not so long or heavy a sword as his father’s Ice but it was Valyrian steel all the same He touched the edge of the blade to mark where the blow must fall and Ygritte shivered That’s cold she said Go on be quick about it

He raised Longclaw over his head both hands tight around the grip One cut with all my weight behind it He could give her a quick clean death at least He was his father’s son Wasn’t he Wasn’t he

Do it she urged him after a moment Bastard Do it I can’t stay brave forever When the blow did not fall she turned her head to look at him

Jon lowered his sword Go he muttered

Ygritte stared

Now he said before my wits return Go

She went





SANSA

The southern sky was black with smoke It rose swirling off a hundred distant fires its sooty fingers smudging out the stars Across the Blackwater Rush a line of flame burned nightly from horizon to horizon while on this side the Imp had fired the whole riverfront docks and warehouses homes and brothels everything outside the city walls

Even in the Red Keep the air tasted of ashes When Sansa found Ser Dontos in the quiet of the godswood he asked if she’d been crying It’s only from the smoke she lied It looks as though half the kingswood is burning

Lord Stannis wants to smoke out the Imp’s savages Dontos swayed as he spoke one hand on the trunk of a chestnut tree A wine stain discolored the red-and-yellow motley of his tunic They kill his scouts and raid his baggage train And the wildlings have been lighting fires too The Imp told the queen that Stannis had better train his horses to eat ash since he would find no blade of grass I heard him say so I hear all sorts of things as a fool that I never heard when I was a knight They talk as though I am not there and—he leaned close breathing his winey breath right in her face—the Spider pays in gold for any little trifle I think Moon Boy has been his for years

He is drunk again My poor Florian he names himself and so he is But he is all I have Is it true Lord Stannis burned the godswood at Storm’s End

Dontos nodded He made a great pyre of the trees as an offering to his new god The red priestess made him do it They say she rules him now body and soul He’s vowed to burn the Great Sept of Baelor too if he takes the city

Let him When Sansa had first beheld the Great Sept with its marble walls and seven crystal towers she’d thought it was the most beautiful building in the world but that had been before Joffrey beheaded her father on its steps I want it burned

Hush child the gods will hear you

Why should they They never hear my prayers

Yes they do They sent me to you didn’t they

Sansa picked at the bark of a tree She felt light-headed almost feverish They sent you but what good have you done You promised you would take me home but I’m still here

Dontos patted her arm I’ve spoken to a certain man I know a good friend to me    and you my lady He will hire a swift ship to take us to safety when the time is right

The time is right now Sansa insisted before the fighting starts They’ve forgotten about me I know we could slip away if we tried

Child child Dontos shook his head Out of the castle yes we could do that but the city gates are more heavily guarded than ever and the Imp has even closed off the river

It was true The Blackwater Rush was as empty as Sansa had ever seen it All the ferries had been withdrawn to the north bank and the trading galleys had fled or been seized by the Imp to be made over for battle The only ships to be seen were the king’s war galleys They rowed endlessly up and down staying to the deep water in the middle of the river and exchanging flights of arrows with Stannis’s archers on the south shore

Lord Stannis himself was still on the march but his vanguard had appeared two nights ago during the black of the moon King’s Landing had woken to the sight of their tents and banners They were five thousand Sansa had heard near as many as all the gold cloaks in the city They flew the red or green apples of House Fossoway the turtle of Estermont and the fox-and-flowers of Florent and their commander was Ser Guyard Morrigen a famous southron knight who men now called Guyard the Green His standard showed a crow in flight its black wings spread wide against a storm-green sky But it was the pale yellow banners that worried the city Long ragged tails streamed behind them like flickering flames and in place of a lord’s sigil they bore the device of a god the burning heart of the Lord of Light

When Stannis comes he’ll have ten times as many men as Joffrey does everyone says so

Dontos squeezed her shoulder The size of his host does not matter sweetling so long as they are on the wrong side of the river Stannis cannot cross without ships

He has ships More than Joffrey

It’s a long sail from Storm’s End the fleet will need to come up Massey’s Hook and through the Gullet and across Blackwater Bay Perhaps the good gods will send a storm to sweep them from the seas Dontos gave a hopeful smile It is not easy for you I know You must be patient child When my friend returns to the city we shall have our ship Have faith in your Florian and try not to be afraid

Sansa dug her nails into her hand She could feel the fear in her tummy twisting and pinching worse every day Nightmares of the day Princess Myrcella had sailed still troubled her sleep dark suffocating dreams that woke her in the black of night struggling for breath She could hear the people screaming at her screaming without words like animals They had hemmed her in and thrown filth at her and tried to pull her off her horse and would have done worse if the Hound had not cut his way to her side They had torn the High Septon to pieces and smashed in Ser Aron’s head with a rock Try not to be afraid he said

The whole city was afraid Sansa could see it from the castle walls The smallfolk were hiding themselves behind closed shutters and barred doors as if that would keep them safe The last time King’s Landing had fallen the Lannisters looted and raped as they pleased and put hundreds to the sword even though the city had opened its gates This time the Imp meant to fight and a city that fought could expect no mercy at all

Dontos was prattling on If I were still a knight I should have to put on armor and man the walls with the rest I ought to kiss King Joffrey’s feet and thank him sweetly

If you thanked him for making you a fool he’d make you a knight again Sansa said sharply

Dontos chuckled My Jonquil’s a clever girl isn’t she

Joffrey and his mother say I’m stupid

Let them You’re safer that way sweetling Queen Cersei and the Imp and Lord Varys and their like they all watch each other keen as hawks and pay this one and that one to spy out what the others are doing but no one ever troubles themselves about Lady Tanda’s daughter do they Dontos covered his mouth to stifle a burp Gods preserve you my little Jonquil He was growing weepy The wine did that to him Give your Florian a little kiss now A kiss for luck He swayed toward her

Sansa dodged the wet groping lips kissed him lightly on an unshaven cheek and bid him good night It took all her strength not to weep She had been weeping too much of late It was unseemly she knew but she could not seem to help herself the tears would come sometimes over a trifle and nothing she did could hold them back

The drawbridge to Maegor’s Holdfast was unguarded The Imp had moved most of the gold cloaks to the city walls and the white knights of the Kingsguard had duties more important than dogging her heels Sansa could go where she would so long as she did not try to leave the castle but there was nowhere she wanted to go

She crossed over the dry moat with its cruel iron spikes and made her way up the narrow turnpike stair but when she reached the door of her bedchamber she could not bear to enter The very walls of the room made her feel trapped even with the window opened wide it felt as though there were no air to breathe

Turning back to the stair Sansa climbed The smoke blotted out the stars and the thin crescent of moon so the roof was dark and thick with shadows Yet from here she could see everything the Red Keep’s tall towers and great cornerforts the maze of city streets beyond to south and west the river running black the bay to the east the columns of smoke and cinders and fires fires everywhere Soldiers crawled over the city walls like ants with torches and crowded the hoardings that had sprouted from the ramparts Down by the Mud Gate outlined against the drifting smoke she could make out the vague shape of the three huge catapults the biggest anyone had ever seen overtopping the walls by a good twenty feet Yet none of it made her feel less fearful A stab went through her so sharp that Sansa sobbed and clutched at her belly She might have fallen but a shadow moved suddenly and strong fingers grabbed her arm and steadied her

She grabbed a merlon for support her fingers scrabbling at the rough stone Let go of me she cried Let go

The little bird thinks she has wings does she Or do you mean to end up crippled like that brother of yours

Sansa twisted in his grasp I wasn’t going to fall It was only    you startled me that’s all

You mean I scared you And still do

She took a deep breath to calm herself I thought I was alone I    She glanced away

The little bird still can’t bear to look at me can she The Hound released her You were glad enough to see my face when the mob had you though Remember

Sansa remembered all too well She remembered the way they had howled the feel of the blood running down her cheek from where the stone had struck her and the garlic stink on the breath of the man who had tried to pull her from her horse She could still feel the cruel pinch of fingers on her wrist as she lost her balance and began to fall

She’d thought she was going to die then but the fingers had twitched all five at once and the man had shrieked loud as a horse When his hand fell away another hand stronger shoved her back into her saddle The man with the garlicky breath was on the ground blood pumping out the stump of his arm but there were others all around some with clubs in hand The Hound leapt at them his sword a blur of steel that trailed a red mist as it swung When they broke and ran before him he had laughed his terrible burned face for a moment transformed

She made herself look at that face now really look It was only courteous and a lady must never forget her courtesies The scars are not the worst part nor even the way his mouth twitches It’s his eyes She had never seen eyes so full of anger I    I should have come to you after she said haltingly To thank you for    for saving me    you were so brave
