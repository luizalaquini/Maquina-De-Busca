I suppose it was also the Halfhand who commanded you to fuck this unwashed whore Ser Alliser asked with a smirk

Ser She was no whore ser The Halfhand told me not to balk whatever the wildlings asked of me but… I will not deny that I went beyond what I had to do that I… cared for her

You admit to being an oathbreaker then said Janos Slynt

Half the men at Castle Black visited Mole’s Town from time to time to dig for buried treasures in the brothel Jon knew but he would not dishonor Ygritte by equating her with the Mole’s Town whores I broke my vows with a woman I admit that Yes

Yes m’lord When Slynt scowled his jowls quivered He was as broad as the Old Bear had been and no doubt would be as bald if he lived to Mormont’s age Half his hair was gone already though he could not have been more than forty

Yes my lord Jon said I rode with the wildlings and ate with them as the Halfhand commanded me and I shared my furs with Ygritte But I swear to you I never turned my cloak I escaped the Magnar as soon as I could and never took up arms against my brothers or the realm

Lord Slynt’s small eyes studied him Ser Glendon he commanded bring in the other prisoner

Ser Glendon was the tall man who had dragged Jon from his bed Four other men went with him when he left the room but they were back soon enough with a captive a small sallow battered man fettered hand and foot He had a single eyebrow a widow’s peak and a mustache that looked like a smear of dirt on his upper lip but his face was swollen and mottled with bruises and most of his front teeth had been knocked out

The Eastwatch men threw the captive roughly to the floor Lord Slynt frowned down at him Is this the one you spoke of

The captive blinked yellow eyes Aye Not until that instant did Jon recognize Rattleshirt He is a different man without his armor he thought Aye the wildling repeated he’s the craven killed the Halfhand Up in the Frostfangs it were after we hunted down t’other crows and killed them every one We would have done for this one too only he begged f’ his worthless life offered t’ join us if we’d have him The Halfhand swore he’d see the craven dead first but the wolf ripped Qhorin half t’ pieces and this one opened his throat He gave Jon a cracktooth smile then and spat blood on his foot

Well Janos Slynt demanded of Jon harshly Do you deny it Or will you claim Qhorin commanded you to kill him

He told me… The words came hard He told me to do whatever they asked of me

Slynt looked about the solar at the other Eastwatch men Does this boy think I fell off a turnip wagon onto my head

Your lies won’t save you now Lord Snow warned Ser Alliser Thorne We’ll have the truth from you bastard

I’ve told you the truth Our garrons were failing and Rattleshirt was close behind us Qhorin told me to pretend to join the wildlings ‘You must not balk whatever is asked of you’ he said He knew they would make me kill him Rattleshirt was going to kill him anyway he knew that too

So now you claim the great Qhorin Halfhand feared this creature Slynt looked at Rattleshirt and snorted

All men fear the Lord o’ Bones the wildling grumbled Ser Glendon kicked him and he lapsed back into silence

I never said that Jon insisted

Slynt slammed a fist on the table I heard you Ser Alliser had your measure true enough it seems You lie through your bastard’s teeth Well I will not suffer it I will not You might have fooled this crippled blacksmith but not Janos Slynt Oh no Janos Slynt does not swallow lies so easily Did you think my skull was stuffed with cabbage

I don’t know what your skull is stuffed with My lord

Lord Snow is nothing if not arrogant said Ser Alliser He murdered Qhorin just as his fellow turncloaks did Lord Mormont It would not surprise me to learn that it was all part of the same fell plot Benjen Stark may well have a hand in all this as well For all we know he is sitting in Mance Rayder’s tent even now You know these Starks my lord

I do said Janos Slynt I know them too well

Jon peeled off his glove and showed them his burned hand I burned my hand defending Lord Mormont from a wight And my uncle was a man of honor He would never have betrayed his vows

No more than you mocked Ser Alliser

Septon Cellador cleared his throat Lord Slynt he said this boy refused to swear his vows properly in the sept but went beyond the Wall to say his words before a heart tree His father’s gods he said but they are wildling gods as well

They are the gods of the north Septon Maester Aemon was courteous but firm My lords when Donal Noye was slain it was this young man Jon Snow who took the Wall and held it against all the fury of the north He has proved himself valiant loyal and resourceful Were it not for him you would have found Mance Rayder sitting here when you arrived Lord Slynt You are doing him a great wrong Jon Snow was Lord Mormont’s own steward and squire He was chosen for that duty because the Lord Commander saw much promise in him As do I

Promise said Slynt Well promise may turn false Qhorin Halfhand’s blood is on his hands Mormont trusted him you say but what of that I know what it is to be betrayed by men you trusted Oh yes And I know the ways of wolves as well He pointed at Jon’s face Your father died a traitor
