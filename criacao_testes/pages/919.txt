wisdom of this world nor of the princes of this world that come to
nought 27 But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery even the
hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world unto our glory 28
Which none of the princes of this world knew for had they known it
they would not have crucified the Lord of glory

29 But as it is written Eye hath not seen nor ear heard neither
have entered into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared
for them that love him

210 But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit for the Spirit
searcheth all things yea the deep things of God

211 For what man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of man
which is in him even so the things of God knoweth no man but the
Spirit of God

212 Now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit
which is of God that we might know the things that are freely given
to us of God

213 Which things also we speak not in the words which mans wisdom
teacheth but which the Holy Ghost teacheth comparing spiritual
things with spiritual

214 But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of
God for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them
because they are spiritually discerned

215 But he that is spiritual judgeth all things yet he himself is
judged of no man

216 For who hath known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct
him  But we have the mind of Christ

31 And I brethren could not speak unto you as unto spiritual but
as unto carnal even as unto babes in Christ

32 I have fed you with milk and not with meat for hitherto ye were
not able to bear it neither yet now are ye able

33 For ye are yet carnal for whereas there is among you envying and
strife and divisions are ye not carnal and walk as men  34 For
while one saith I am of Paul and another I am of Apollos are ye
not carnal  35 Who then is Paul and who is Apollos but ministers
by whom ye believed even as the Lord gave to every man  36 I have
planted Apollos watered but God gave the increase

37 So then neither is he that planteth any thing neither he that
watereth but God that giveth the increase

38 Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one and every man
shall receive his own reward according to his own labour

39 For we are labourers together with God ye are Gods husbandry ye
are Gods building

310 According to the grace of God which is given unto me as a wise
masterbuilder I have laid the foundation and another buildeth
thereon But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon

311 For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid which is
Jesus Christ

312 Now if any man build upon this foundation gold silver precious
stones wood hay stubble 313 Every mans work shall be made
manifest for the day shall declare it because it shall be revealed
by fire and the fire shall try every mans work of what sort it is

314 If any mans work abide which he hath built thereupon he shall
receive a reward

315 If any mans work shall be burned he shall suffer loss but he
himself shall be saved yet so as by fire

316 Know ye not that ye are the temple of God and that the Spirit of
God dwelleth in you  317 If any man defile the temple of God him
shall God destroy for the temple of God is holy which temple ye are

318 Let no man deceive himself If any man among you seemeth to be
wise in this world let him become a fool that he may be wise

319 For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God For it is
written He taketh the wise in their own craftiness

320 And again The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise that they
are vain

321 Therefore let no man glory in men For all things are yours
322 Whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or
death or things present or things to come all are yours 323 And
ye are Christs and Christ is Gods

41 Let a man so account of us as of the ministers of Christ and
stewards of the mysteries of God

42 Moreover it is required in stewards that a man be found faithful

43 But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of
you or of mans judgment yea I judge not mine own self
