A wildling arrow It was not a question Noye had only one arm but that was thick with muscle He slid it under Jon’s to help support him You’re white as milk and burning hot besides I’m taking you to Aemon

There’s no time There are wildlings south of the Wall coming up from Queenscrown to open the gate

How many Noye half-carried Jon out the door

A hundred and twenty and well armed for wildlings Bronze armor some bits of steel How many men are left here

Forty odd said Donal Noye The crippled and infirm and some green boys still in training

If Marsh is gone who did he name as castellan

The armorer laughed Ser Wynton gods preserve him Last knight in the castle and all The thing is Stout seems to have forgotten and no one’s been rushing to remind him I suppose I’m as much a commander as we have now The meanest of the cripples

That was for the good at least The one-armed armorer was hard headed tough and well seasoned in war Ser Wynton Stout on the other hand… well he had been a good man once everyone agreed but he had been eighty years a ranger and both strength and wits were gone Once he’d fallen asleep at supper and almost drowned in a bowl of pea soup

Where’s your wolf Noye asked as they crossed the yard

Ghost I had to leave him when I climbed the Wall I’d hoped he’d make his way back here

I’m sorry lad There’s been no sign of him They limped up to the maester’s door in the long wooden keep beneath the rookery The armorer gave it a kick Clydas

After a moment a stooped round-shouldered little man in black peered out His small pink eyes widened at the sight of Jon Lay the lad down I’ll fetch the maester

A fire was burning in the hearth and the room was almost stuffy The warmth made Jon sleepy As soon as Noye eased him down onto his back he closed his eyes to stop the world from spinning He could hear the ravens quorking and complaining in the rookery above Snow one bird was saying Snow snow snow That was Sam’s doing Jon remembered Had Samwell Tarly made it home safely he wondered or only the birds

Maester Aemon was not long in coming He moved slowly one spotted hand on Clydas’s arm as he shuffled forward with small careful steps Around his thin neck his chain hung heavy gold and silver links glinting amongst iron lead tin and other base metals Jon Snow he said you must tell me all you’ve seen and done when you are stronger Donal put a kettle of wine on the fire and my irons as well I will want them red-hot Clydas I shall need that good sharp knife of yours The maester was more than a hundred years old shrunken frail hairless and quite blind But if his milky eyes saw nothing his wits were still as sharp as they had ever been

There are wildlings coming Jon told him as Clydas ran a blade up the leg of his breeches slicing the heavy black cloth crusty with old blood and sodden with new From the south We climbed the Wall…

Maester Aemon gave Jon’s crude bandage a sniff when Clydas cut it away We

I was with them Qhorin Halfhand commanded me to join them Jon winced as the maester’s finger explored his wound poking and prodding The Magnar of Thenn—aaaaah that hurts He clenched his teeth Where is the Old Bear

Jon… it grieves me to say but Lord Commander Mormont was murdered at Craster’s Keep at the hands of his Sworn Brothers

Bro… our own men Aemon’s words hurt a hundred times worse than his fingers Jon remembered the Old Bear as last he’d seen him standing before his tent with his raven on his arm croaking for corn Mormont gone He had feared it ever since he’d seen the aftermath of battle on the Fist yet it was no less a blow Who was it Who turned on him

Garth of Oldtown Ollo Lophand Dirk… thieves cowards and killers the lot of them We should have seen it coming The Watch is not what it was Too few honest men to keep the rogues in line Donal Noye turned the maester’s blades in the fire A dozen true men made it back Dolorous Edd Giant your friend the Aurochs We had the tale from them

Only a dozen Two hundred men had left Castle Black with Lord Commander Mormont two hundred of the Watch’s best Does this mean Marsh is Lord Commander then The Old Pomegranate was amiable and a diligent First Steward but he was woefully ill-suited to face a wildling host

For the nonce until we can hold a choosing said Maester Aemon Clydas bring me the flask

A choosing With Qhorin Halfhand and Ser Jaremy Rykker both dead and Ben Stark still missing who was there Not Bowen Marsh or Ser Wynton Stout that was certain Had Thoren Smallwood survived the Fist or Ser Ottyn Wythers No it will be Cotter Pyke or Ser Denys Mallister Which though The commanders at the Shadow Tower and Eastwatch were good men but very different Ser Denys courtly and cautious as chivalrous as he was elderly Pyke younger bastard-born rough-tongued and bold to a fault Worse the two men despised each other The Old Bear had always kept them far apart at opposite ends of the Wall The Mallisters had a bone-deep mistrust of the ironborn Jon knew

A stab of pain reminded him of his own woes The maester squeezed his hand Clydas is bringing milk of the poppy

Jon tried to rise I don’t need—

You do Aemon said firmly This will hurt

Donal Noye crossed the room and shoved Jon back onto his back Be still or I’ll tie you down Even with only one arm the smith handled him as if he were a child Clydas returned with a green flask and a rounded stone cup Maester Aemon poured it full Drink this
