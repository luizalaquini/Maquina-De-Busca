This is as far as we go unless you have a man inside to lift the gate for us His whispers scurried across the lapping water like a line of mice on soft pink feet

Have we passed within the walls

Yes Beneath But we can go no farther The portcullis goes all the way to the bottom And the bars are too closely spaced for even a child to squeeze through

There was no answer but a soft rustling And then a light bloomed amidst the darkness

Davos raised a hand to shield his eyes and his breath caught in his throat Melisandre had thrown back her cowl and shrugged out of the smothering robe Beneath she was naked and huge with child Swollen breasts hung heavy against her chest and her belly bulged as if near to bursting Gods preserve us he whispered and heard her answering laugh deep and throaty Her eyes were hot coals and the sweat that dappled her skin seemed to glow with a light of its own Melisandre shone

Panting she squatted and spread her legs Blood ran down her thighs black as ink Her cry might have been agony or ecstasy or both And Davos saw the crown of the child’s head push its way out of her Two arms wriggled free grasping black fingers coiling around Melisandre’s straining thighs pushing until the whole of the shadow slid out into the world and rose taller than Davos tall as the tunnel towering above the boat He had only an instant to look at it before it was gone twisting between the bars of the portcullis and racing across the surface of the water but that instant was long enough

He knew that shadow As he knew the man who’d cast it





JON

The call came drifting through the black of night Jon pushed himself onto an elbow his hand reaching for Longclaw by force of habit as the camp began to stir The horn that wakes the sleepers he thought

The long low note lingered at the edge of hearing The sentries at the ringwall stood still in their footsteps breath frosting and heads turned toward the west As the sound of the horn faded even the wind ceased to blow Men rolled from their blankets and reached for spears and swordbelts moving quietly listening A horse whickered and was hushed For a heartbeat it seemed as if the whole forest were holding its breath The brothers of the Night’s Watch waited for a second blast praying they should not hear it fearing that they would

When the silence had stretched unbearably long and the men knew at last that the horn would not wind again they grinned at one another sheepishly as if to deny that they had been anxious Jon Snow fed a few sticks to the fire buckled on his swordbelt pulled on his boots shook the dirt and dew from the cloak and fastened it around his shoulders The flames blazed up beside him welcome heat beating against his face as he dressed He could hear the Lord Commander moving inside the tent After a moment Mormont lifted the flap One blast On his shoulder his raven sat fluffed and silent looking miserable

One my lord Jon agreed Brothers returning

Mormont moved to the fire The Halfhand And past time He had grown more restive every day they waited much longer and he would have been fit to whelp cubs See that there’s hot food for the men and fodder for the horses I’ll see Qhorin at once

I’ll bring him my lord The men from the Shadow Tower had been expected days ago When they had not appeared the brothers had begun to wonder Jon had heard gloomy mutterings around the cookfire and not just from Dolorous Edd Ser Ottyn Wythers was for retreating to Castle Black as soon as possible Ser Mallador Locke would strike for the Shadow Tower hoping to pick up Qhorin’s trail and learn what had befallen him And Thoren Smallwood wanted to push on into the mountains Mance Rayder knows he must battle the Watch Thoren had declared but he will never look for us so far north If we ride up the Milkwater we can take him unawares and cut his host to ribbons before he knows we are on him

The numbers would be greatly against us Ser Ottyn had objected Craster said he was gathering a great host Many thousands Without Qhorin we are only two hundred

Send two hundred wolves against ten thousand sheep ser and see what happens said Smallwood confidently

There are goats among these sheep Thoren warned Jarman Buckwell Aye and maybe a few lions Rattleshirt Harma the Dogshead Alfyn Crowkiller   

I know them as well as you do Buckwell Thoren Smallwood snapped back And I mean to have their heads every one These are wildlings No soldiers A few hundred heroes drunk most like amidst a great horde of women children and thralls We will sweep over them and send them howling back to their hovels

They had argued for many hours and reached no agreement The Old Bear was too stubborn to retreat but neither would he rush headlong up the Milkwater seeking battle In the end nothing had been decided but to wait a few more days for the men from the Shadow Tower and talk again if they did not appear

And now they had which meant that the decision could be delayed no longer Jon was glad of that much at least If they must battle Mance Rayder let it be soon

He found Dolorous Edd at the fire complaining about how difficult it was for him to sleep when people insisted on blowing horns in the woods Jon gave him something new to complain about Together they woke Hake who received the Lord Commander’s orders with a stream of curses but got up all the same and soon had a dozen brothers cutting roots for a soup

Sam came puffing up as Jon crossed the camp Under the black hood his face was as pale and round as the moon I heard the horn Has your uncle come back

It’s only the men from the Shadow Tower It was growing harder to cling to the hope of Benjen Stark’s safe return The cloak he had found beneath the Fist could well have belonged to his uncle or one of his men even the Old Bear admitted as much though why they would have buried it there wrapped around the cache of dragonglass no one could say Sam I have to go

At the ringwall he found the guards sliding spikes from the half-frozen earth to make an opening It was not long until the first of the brothers from the Shadow Tower began wending their way up the slope All in leather and fur they were with here and there a bit of steel or bronze heavy beards covered hard lean faces and made them look as shaggy as their garrons Jon was surprised to see some of them were riding two to a horse When he looked more closely it was plain that many of them were wounded There has been trouble on the way

Jon knew Qhorin Halfhand the instant he saw him though they had never met The big ranger was half a legend in the Watch a man of slow words and swift action tall and straight as a spear long-limbed and solemn Unlike his men he was clean-shaven His hair fell from beneath his helm in a heavy braid touched with hoarfrost and the blacks he wore were so faded they might have been greys Only thumb and forefinger remained on the hand that held the reins the other fingers had been sheared off catching a wildling’s axe that would otherwise have split his skull It was told that he had thrust his maimed fist into the face of the axeman so the blood spurted into his eyes and slew him while he was blind Since that day the wildlings beyond the Wall had known no foe more implacable

Jon hailed him Lord Commander Mormont would see you at once I’ll show you to his tent

Qhorin swung down from his saddle My men are hungry and our horses require tending

They’ll all be seen to

The ranger gave his horse into the care of one of his men and followed You are Jon Snow You have your father’s look

Did you know him my lord

I am no lordling Only a brother of the Night’s Watch I knew Lord Eddard yes And his father before him

Jon had to hurry his steps to keep up with Qhorin’s long strides Lord Rickard died before I was born

He was a friend to the Watch Qhorin glanced behind It is said that a direwolf runs with you

Ghost should be back by dawn He hunts at night

They found Dolorous Edd frying a rasher of bacon and boiling a dozen eggs in a kettle over the Old Bear’s cookfire Mormont sat in his wood-and-leather camp chair I had begun to fear for you Did you meet with trouble

We met with Alfyn Crowkiller Mance had sent him to scout along the Wall and we chanced on him returning Qhorin removed his helm Alfyn will trouble the realm no longer but some of his company escaped us We hunted down as many as we could but it may be that a few will win back to the mountains

And the cost

Four brothers dead A dozen wounded A third as many as the foe And we took captives One died quickly from his wounds but the other lived long enough to be questioned

Best talk of this inside Jon will fetch you a horn of ale Or would you prefer hot spiced wine

Boiled water will suffice An egg and a bite of bacon

As you wish Mormont lifted the flap of the tent and Qhorin Halfhand stooped and stepped through

Edd stood over the kettle swishing the eggs about with a spoon I envy those eggs he said I could do with a bit of boiling about now If the kettle were larger I might jump in Though I would sooner it were wine than water There are worse ways to die than warm and drunk I knew a brother drowned himself in wine once It was a poor vintage though and his corpse did not improve it

You drank the wine

It’s an awful thing to find a brother dead You’d have need of a drink as well Lord Snow Edd stirred the kettle and added a pinch more nutmeg

Restless Jon squatted by the fire and poked at it with a stick He could hear the Old Bear’s voice inside the tent punctuated by the raven’s squawks and Qhorin Halfhand’s quieter tones but he could not make out the words Alfyn Crowkiller dead that’s good He was one of the bloodiest of the wildling raiders taking his name from the black brothers he’d slain So why does Qhorin sound so grave after such a victory

Jon had hoped that the arrival of men from the Shadow Tower would lift the spirits in the camp Only last night he was coming back through the dark from a piss when he heard five or six men talking in low voices around the embers of a fire When he heard Chett muttering that it was past time they turned back Jon stopped to listen It’s an old man’s folly this ranging he heard We’ll find nothing but our graves in them mountains

There’s giants in the Frostfangs and wargs and worse things said Lark the Sisterman

I’ll not be going there I promise you
