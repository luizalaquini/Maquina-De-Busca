The ground was littered with pine needles and blown leaves a carpet of green and brown still damp from the recent rains It squished beneath their feet Huge bare oaks tall sentinels and hosts of soldier pines stood all around them On a hill above them was another roundtower ancient and empty thick green moss crawling up its side almost to the summit Who built that all of stone like that Ygritte asked him Some king

No Just the men who used to live here

What happened to them

They died or went away Brandon’s Gift had been farmed for thousands of years but as the Watch dwindled there were fewer hands to plow the fields tend the bees and plant the orchards so the wild had reclaimed many a field and hall In the New Gift there had been villages and holdfasts whose taxes rendered in goods and labor helped feed and clothe the black brothers But those were largely gone as well

They were fools to leave such a castle said Ygritte

It’s only a towerhouse Some little lordling lived there once with his family and a few sworn men When raiders came he would light a beacon from the roof Winterfell has towers three times the size of that

She looked as if she thought he was making that up How could men build so high with no giants to lift the stones

In legend Brandon the Builder had used giants to help raise Winterfell but Jon did not want to confuse the issue Men can build a lot higher than this In Oldtown there’s a tower taller than the Wall He could tell she did not believe him If I could show her Winterfell… give her a flower from the glass gardens feast her in the Great Hall and show her the stone kings on their thrones We could bathe in the hot pools and love beneath the heart tree while the old gods watched over us

The dream was sweet… but Winterfell would never be his to show It belonged to his brother the King in the North He was a Snow not a Stark Bastard oathbreaker and turncloak…

Might be after we could come back here and live in that tower she said Would you want that Jon Snow After

After The word was a spear thrust After the war After the conquest After the wildlings break the Wall…

His lord father had once talked about raising new lords and settling them in the abandoned holdfasts as a shield against wildlings The plan would have required the Watch to yield back a large part of the Gift but his uncle Benjen believed the Lord Commander could be won around so long as the new lordlings paid taxes to Castle Black rather than Winterfell It is a dream for spring though Lord Eddard had said Even the promise of land will not lure men north with a winter coming on

If winter had come and gone more quickly and spring had followed in its turn I might have been chosen to hold one of these towers in my father’s name Lord Eddard was dead however his brother Benjen lost the shield they dreamt together would never be forged This land belongs to the Watch Jon said

Her nostrils flared No one lives here

Your raiders drove them off

They were cowards then If they wanted the land they should have stayed and fought

Maybe they were tired of fighting Tired of barring their doors every night and wondering if Rattleshirt or someone like him would break them down to carry off their wives Tired of having their harvests stolen and any valuables they might have It’s easier to move beyond the reach of raiders But if the Wall should fail all the north will lie within the reach of raiders

You know nothing Jon Snow Daughters are taken not wives You’re the ones who steal You took the whole world and built the Wall t’ keep the free folk out

Did we Sometimes Jon forgot how wild she was and then she would remind him How did that happen

The gods made the earth for all men t’ share Only when the kings come with their crowns and steel swords they claimed it was all theirs My trees they said you can’t eat them apples My stream you can’t fish here My wood you’re not t’ hunt My earth my water my castle my daughter keep your hands away or I’ll chop ’em off but maybe if you kneel t’ me I’ll let you have a sniff You call us thieves but at least a thief has t’ be brave and clever and quick A kneeler only has t’ kneel

Harma and the Bag of Bones don’t come raiding for fish and apples They steal swords and axes Spices silks and furs They grab every coin and ring and jeweled cup they can find casks of wine in summer and casks of beef in winter and they take women in any season and carry them off beyond the Wall

And what if they do I’d sooner be stolen by a strong man than be given t’ some weakling by my father

You say that but how can you know What if you were stolen by someone you hated

He’d have t’ be quick and cunning and brave t’ steal me So his sons would be strong and smart as well Why would I hate such a man as that

Maybe he never washes so he smells as rank as a bear

Then I’d push him in a stream or throw a bucket o’ water on him Anyhow men shouldn’t smell sweet like flowers

What’s wrong with flowers

Nothing for a bee For bed I want one o’ these Ygritte made to grab the front of his breeches

Jon caught her wrist What if the man who stole you drank too much he insisted What if he was brutal or cruel He tightened his grip to make a point What if he was stronger than you and liked to beat you bloody

I’d cut his throat while he slept You know nothing Jon Snow Ygritte twisted like an eel and wrenched away from him

I know one thing I know that you are wildling to the bone It was easy to forget that sometimes when they were laughing together or kissing But then one of them would say something or do something and he would suddenly be reminded of the wall between their worlds

A man can own a woman or a man can own a knife Ygritte told him but no man can own both Every little girl learns that from her mother She raised her chin defiantly and gave her thick red hair a shake And men can’t own the land no more’n they can own the sea or the sky You kneelers think you do but Mance is going t’ show you different

It was a fine brave boast but it rang hollow Jon glanced back to make certain the Magnar was not in earshot Errok Big Boil and Hempen Dan were walking a few yards behind them but paying no attention Big Boil was complaining of his arse Ygritte he said in a low voice Mance cannot win this war

He can she insisted You know nothing Jon Snow You have never seen the free folk fight

Wildlings fought like heroes or demons depending on who you talked to but it came down to the same thing in the end They fight with reckless courage every man out for glory I don’t doubt that you’re all very brave but when it comes to battle discipline beats valor every time In the end Mance will fail as all the Kings-beyond-the-Wall have failed before him And when he does you’ll die All of you

Ygritte had looked so angry he thought she was about to strike him All of us she said You too You’re no crow now Jon Snow I swore you weren’t so you better not be She pushed him back against the trunk of a tree and kissed him full on the lips right there in the midst of the ragged column Jon heard Grigg the Goat urging her on Someone else laughed He kissed her back despite all that When they finally broke apart Ygritte was flushed You’re mine she whispered Mine as I’m yours And if we die we die All men must die Jon Snow But first we’ll live

Yes His voice was thick First we’ll live

She grinned at that showing Jon the crooked teeth that he had somehow come to love Wildling to the bone he thought again with a sick sad feeling in the pit of his stomach He flexed the fingers of his sword hand and wondered what Ygritte would do if she knew his heart Would she betray him if he sat her down and told her that he was still Ned Stark’s son and a man of the Night’s Watch He hoped not but he dare not take that risk Too many lives depended on his somehow reaching Castle Black before the Magnar… assuming he found a chance to escape the wildlings

They had descended the south face of the Wall at Greyguard abandoned for two hundred years A section of the huge stone steps had collapsed a century before but even so the descent was a good deal easier than the climb From there Styr marched them deep into the Gift to avoid the Watch’s customary patrols Grigg the Goat led them past the few inhabited villages that remained in these lands Aside from a few scattered roundtowers poking the sky like stone fingers they saw no sign of man Through cold wet hills and windy plains they marched unwatched unseen

You must not balk whatever is asked of you the Halfhand had said Ride with them eat with them fight with them for as long as it takes He’d ridden many leagues and walked for more had shared their bread and salt and Ygritte’s blankets as well but still they did not trust him Day and night the Thenns watched him alert for any signs of betrayal He could not get away and soon it would be too late

Fight with them Qhorin had said before he surrendered his own life to Longclaw… but it had not come to that till now Once I shed a brother’s blood I am lost I cross the Wall for good then and there is no crossing back

After each day’s march the Magnar summoned him to ask shrewd sharp questions about Castle Black its garrison and defenses Jon lied where he dared and feigned ignorance a few times but Grigg the Goat and Errok listened as well and they knew enough to make Jon careful Too blatant a lie would betray him

But the truth was terrible Castle Black had no defenses but for the Wall itself It lacked even wooden palisades or earthen dikes The castle was nothing more than a cluster of towers and keeps two-thirds of them falling into ruin As for the garrison the Old Bear had taken two hundred on his ranging Had any returned Jon could not know Perhaps four hundred remained at the castle but most of those were builders or stewards not rangers

The Thenns were hardened warriors and more disciplined than the common run of wildling no doubt that was why Mance had chosen them The defenders of Castle Black would include blind Maester Aemon and his half-blind steward Clydas one-armed Donal Noye drunken Septon Cellador Deaf Dick Follard Three-Finger Hobb the cook old Ser Wynton Stout as well as Halder and Toad and Pyp and Albett and the rest of the boys who’d trained with Jon And commanding them would be red-faced Bowen Marsh the plump Lord Steward who had been made castellan in Lord Mormont’s absence Dolorous Edd sometimes called Marsh the Old Pomegranate which fit him just as well as the Old Bear fit Mormont He’s the man you want in front when the foes are in the field Edd would say in his usual dour voice He’ll count them right up for you A regular demon for counting that one

If the Magnar takes Castle Black unawares it will be red slaughter boys butchered in their beds before they know they are under attack Jon had to warn them but how He was never sent out to forage or hunt nor allowed to stand a watch alone And he feared for Ygritte as well He could not take her but if he left her would the Magnar make her answer for his treachery Two hearts that beat as one…

They shared the same sleeping skins every night and he went to sleep with her head against his chest and her red hair tickling his chin The smell of her had become a part of him Her crooked teeth the feel of her breast when he cupped it in his hand the taste of her mouth… they were his joy and his despair Many a night he lay with Ygritte warm beside him wondering if his lord father had felt this confused about his mother whoever she had been Ygritte set the trap and Mance Rayder pushed me into it

Every day he spent among the wildlings made what he had to do that much harder He was going to have to find some way to betray these men and when he did they would die He did not want their friendship any more than he wanted Ygritte’s love And yet… the Thenns spoke the Old Tongue and seldom talked to Jon at all but it was different with Jarl’s raiders the men who’d climbed the Wall Jon was coming to know them despite himself gaunt quiet Errok and gregarious Grigg the Goat the boys Quort and Bodger Hempen Dan the ropemaker The worst of the lot was Del a horsefaced youth near Jon’s own age who would talk dreamily of this wildling girl he meant to steal She’s lucky like your Ygritte She’s kissed by fire

Jon had to bite his tongue He didn’t want to know about Del’s girl or Bodger’s mother the place by the sea that Henk the Helm came from how Grigg yearned to visit the green men on the Isle of Faces or the time a moose had chased Toefinger up a tree He didn’t want to hear about the boil on Big Boil’s arse how much ale Stone Thumbs could drink or how Quort’s little brother had begged him not to go with Jarl Quort could not have been older than fourteen though he’d already stolen himself a wife and had a child on the way Might be he’ll be born in some castle the boy boasted Born in a castle like a lord He was very taken with the castles they’d seen by which he meant watchtowers

Jon wondered where Ghost was now Had he gone to Castle Black or was he was running with some wolfpack in the woods He had no sense of the direwolf not even in his dreams It made him feel as if part of himself had been cut off Even with Ygritte sleeping beside him he felt alone He did not want to die alone

By that afternoon the trees had begun to thin and they marched east over gently rolling plains Grass rose waist high around them and stands of wild wheat swayed gently when the wind came gusting but for the most part the day was warm and bright Toward sunset however clouds began to threaten in the west They soon engulfed the orange sun and Lenn foretold a bad storm coming His mother was a woods witch so all the raiders agreed he had a gift for foretelling the weather There’s a village close Grigg the Goat told the Magnar Two miles three We could shelter there Styr agreed at once
