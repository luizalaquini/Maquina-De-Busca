And my brother Ser Garlan said the Knight of Flowers

Will they keep him safe

They will my lord

Be seated then The words were ritual Before the seven could meet in session the king’s safety must be assured

Ser Boros and Ser Meryn sat to his right leaving an empty chair between them for Ser Arys Oakheart off in Dorne Ser Osmund Ser Balon and Ser Loras took the seats to his left The old and the new Jaime wondered if that meant anything There had been times during its history where the Kingsguard had been divided against itself most notably and bitterly during the Dance of the Dragons Was that something he needed to fear as well

It seemed queer to him to sit in the Lord Commander’s seat where Barristan the Bold had sat for so many years And even queerer to sit here crippled Nonetheless it was his seat and this was his Kingsguard now Tommen’s seven

Jaime had served with Meryn Trant and Boros Blount for years adequate fighters but Trant was sly and cruel and Blount a bag of growly air Ser Balon Swann was better suited to his cloak and of course the Knight of Flowers was supposedly all a knight should be The fifth man was a stranger to him this Osmund Kettleblack

He wondered what Ser Arthur Dayne would have to say of this lot How is it that the Kingsguard has fallen so low most like It was my doing I would have to answer I opened the door and did nothing when the vermin began to crawl inside

The king is dead Jaime began My sister’s son a boy of thirteen murdered at his own wedding feast in his own hall All five of you were present All five of you were protecting him And yet he’s dead He waited to see what they would say to that but none of them so much as cleared a throat The Tyrell boy is angry and Balon Swann’s ashamed he judged From the other three Jaime sensed only indifference Did my brother do this thing he asked them bluntly Did Tyrion poison my nephew

Ser Balon shifted uncomfortably in his seat Ser Boros made a fist Ser Osmund gave a lazy shrug It was Meryn Trant who finally answered He filled Joffrey’s cup with wine That must have been when he slipped the poison in

You are certain it was the wine that was poisoned

What else said Ser Boros Blount The Imp emptied the dregs on the floor Why but to spill the wine that might have proved him guilty

He knew the wine was poisoned said Ser Meryn

Ser Balon Swann frowned The Imp was not alone on the dais Far from it That late in the feast we had people standing and moving about changing places slipping off to the privy servants were coming and going… the king and queen had just opened the wedding pie every eye was on them or those thrice-damned doves No one was watching the wine cup

Who else was on the dais asked Jaime

Ser Meryn answered The king’s family the bride’s family Grand Maester Pycelle the High Septon…

There’s your poisoner suggested Ser Oswald Kettleblack with a sly grin Too holy by half that old man Never liked the look o’ him myself He laughed

No the Knight of Flowers said unamused Sansa Stark was the poisoner You all forget my sister was drinking from that chalice as well Sansa Stark was the only person in the hall who had reason to want Margaery dead as well as the king By poisoning the wedding cup she could hope to kill both of them And why did she run afterward unless she was guilty

The boy makes sense Tyrion might yet be innocent No one was any closer to finding the girl however Perhaps Jaime should look into that himself For a start it would be good to know how she had gotten out of the castle Varys may have a notion or two about that No one knew the Red Keep better than the eunuch

That could wait however Just now Jaime had more immediate concerns You say you are the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard his father had said Go do your duty These five were not the brothers he would have chosen but they were the brothers he had the time had come to take them in hand

Whoever did it he told them Joffrey is dead and the Iron Throne belongs to Tommen now I mean for him to sit on it until his hair turns white and his teeth fall out And not from poison Jaime turned to Ser Boros Blount The man had grown stout in recent years though he was big-boned enough to carry it Ser Boros you look like a man who enjoys his food Henceforth you’ll taste everything Tommen eats or drinks

Ser Osmund Kettleblack laughed aloud and the Knight of Flowers smiled but Ser Boros turned a deep beet red I am no food taster I am a knight of the Kingsguard

Sad to say you are Cersei should never have stripped the man of his white cloak But their father had only compounded the shame by restoring it My sister has told me how readily you yielded my nephew to Tyrion’s sellswords You will find carrots and pease less threatening I hope When your Sworn Brothers are training in the yard with sword and shield you may train with spoon and trencher Tommen loves applecakes Try not to let any sellswords make off with them

You speak to me thus You

You should have died before you let Tommen be taken

As you died protecting Aerys ser Ser Boros lurched to his feet and clasped the hilt of his sword I won’t… I won’t suffer this You should be the food taster it seems to me What else is a cripple good for

Jaime smiled I agree I am as unfit to guard the king as you are So draw that sword you’re fondling and we shall see how your two hands fare against my one At the end one of us will be dead and the Kingsguard will be improved He rose Or if you prefer you may return to your duties

Bah Ser Boros hawked up a glob of green phlegm spat it at Jaime’s feet and walked out his sword still in its sheath

The man is craven and a good thing Though fat aging and never more than ordinary Ser Boros could still have hacked him into bloody pieces But Boros does not know that and neither must the rest They feared the man I was the man I am they’d pity

Jaime seated himself again and turned to Kettleblack Ser Osmund I do not know you I find that curious I’ve fought in tourneys mêlées and battles throughout the Seven Kingdoms I know of every hedge knight freerider and upjumped squire of any skill who has ever presumed to break a lance in the lists So how is it that I have never heard of you Ser Osmund

That I couldn’t say my lord He had a great wide smile on his face did Ser Osmund as if he and Jaime were old comrades in arms playing some jolly little game I’m a soldier though not no tourney knight

Where had you served before my sister found you

Here and there my lord

I have been to Oldtown in the south and Winterfell in the north I have been to Lannisport in the west and King’s Landing in the east But I have never been to Here Nor There For want of a finger Jaime pointed his stump at Ser Osmund’s beak of a nose I will ask once more Where have you served

In the Stepstones Some in the Disputed Lands There’s always fighting there I rode with the Gallant Men We fought for Lys and some for Tyrosh

You fought for anyone who would pay you How did you come by your knighthood

On a battlefield

Who knighted you

Ser Robert… Stone He’s dead now my lord

To be sure Ser Robert Stone might have been some bastard from the Vale he supposed selling his sword in the Disputed Lands On the other hand he might be no more than a name Ser Osmund cobbled together from a dead king and a castle wall What was Cersei thinking when she gave this one a white cloak

At least Kettleblack would likely know how to use a sword and shield Sellswords were seldom the most honorable of men but they had to have a certain skill at arms to stay alive Very well ser Jaime said You may go

The man’s grin returned He left swaggering

Ser Meryn Jaime smiled at the sour knight with the rust-red hair and the pouches under his eyes I have heard it said that Joffrey made use of you to chastise Sansa Stark He turned the White Book around one-handed Here show me where it is in our vows that we swear to beat women and children

I did as His Grace commanded me We are sworn to obey

Henceforth you will temper that obedience My sister is Queen Regent My father is the King’s Hand I am Lord Commander of the Kingsguard Obey us None other

Ser Meryn got a stubborn look on his face Are you telling us not to obey the king

The king is eight Our first duty is to protect him which includes protecting him from himself Use that ugly thing you keep inside your helm If Tommen wants you to saddle his horse obey him If he tells you to kill his horse come to me

Aye As you command my lord

Dismissed As he left Jaime turned to Ser Balon Swann Ser Balon I have watched you tilt many a time and fought with and against you in mêlées I’m told you proved your valor a hundred times over during the Battle of the Blackwater The Kingsguard is honored by your presence

The honor’s mine my lord Ser Balon sounded wary
