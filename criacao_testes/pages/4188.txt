During the progress of this dialogue there was a
nervous twitching of Boldwoods tightly closed lips and
his face became bathed in a clammy dew He now
started forward towards Troy Troy turned to him and
took up the bag
Shall I tell her I have come to give her up and
cannot marry her   said the soldier mockingly
No no wait a minute I want to say more to
you -- more to you   said Boldwood in a hoarse whisper
Now said Troy  you see my dilemma Perhaps
I am a bad man -- the victim of my impulses -- led away
to do what I ought to leave undone I cant however
marry them both And I have two reasons for- choosing
Fanny First I like her best upon the whole and
second you make it worth my while
At the same instant Boldwood sprang upon him and
held him by the neck Troy felt Boldwoods grasp slowly
tightening The move was absolutely unexpected
A moment he gasped You are injuring her you
love  
Well what do you mean   said the farmer
Give me breath said Troy
Boldwood loosened his hand saying By Heaven
Ive a mind to kill you 
And ruin her
Save her
Oh how can she be saved now unless I marry her  
P 289
Boldwood groaned He reluctantly released the
soldier and flung him back against the hedge Devil
you torture me   said he
Troy rebounded like a ball and was about to make
a dash at the farmer but he checked himself saying
lightly --
It is not worth while to measure my strength with
you Indeed it is a barbarous way of settling a quarrel
I shall shortly leave the army because of the same
conviction Now after that revelation of how the land
lies with Bathsheba twould be a mistake to kill me
would it not
Twould be a mistake to kill you repeated Boldwood
mechanically with a bowed head
Better kill yourself
 Far better
Im glad you see it
Troy make her your wife and dont act upon what
I arranged just now The alternative is dreadful but
take Bathsheba I give her up  She must love you
indeed to sell soul and body to you so utterly as she
has done Wretched woman -- deluded woman -- you
are Bathsheba  
But about Fanny  
Bathsheba is a woman well to do continued Bold+
wood in nervous anxiety and Troy she will make a
good wife  and indeed she is worth your hastening
on your marriage with her  
But she has a wili-not to say a temper and I shall
be a mere slave to her I could do anything with poor
Fanny Robin
Troy said Boldwood imploringly  Ill do anything
for you only dont desert her pray dont desert her
Troy
Which poor Fanny  
No  Bathsheba Everdene Love her best  Love
her tenderly  How shall I get you to see how advan+
tageous it will be to you to secure her at once 
I dont wish to secure her in any new way
Boldwoods arm moved spasmodically towards Troys
person again He repressed the instinct and his form
drooped as with pain
Troy went on --
P 290
I shall soon purchase my discharge and then --  -- 
But I wish you to hasten on this marriage  It will
be better for you both You love each other and you
must let me help you to do it
How  
Why by settling the five hundred on Bathsheba
instead of Fanny to enable you to marry at once
No  she wouldnt have it of me Ill pay it down to
you on the wedding-day
Troy paused in secret amazement at Boldwoods
wild infatuation He carelessly said And am I to
have anything now  
Yes if you wish to But I have not much additional
money with me I did not expect this but all I have
is yours
Boldwood more like a somnambulist than a wakeful
man pulled out the large canvas bag he carried by way
of a purse and searched it
I have twenty-one pounds more with me he said
Two notes and a sovereign But before I leave you
I must have a paper signed --  -- 
Pay me the money and well go straight to her
parlour and make any arrangement you please to secure
my compliance with your wishes But she must know
nothing of this cash business
 Nothing nothing said Boldwood hastily Here
is the sum and if youll come to my house well write
out the agreement for the remainder and the terms
