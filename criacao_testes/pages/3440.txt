When I was a boy it was said that a long summer always meant a long winter to come This summer has lasted nine years Tyrion and a tenth will soon be upon us Think on that

When I was a boy Tyrion replied my wet nurse told me that one day if men were good the gods would give the world a summer without ending Perhaps we’ve been better than we thought and the Great Summer is finally at hand He grinned

The Lord Commander did not seem amused You are not fool enough to believe that my lord Already the days grow shorter There can be no mistake Aemon has had letters from the Citadel findings in accord with his own The end of summer stares us in the face Mormont reached out and clutched Tyrion tightly by the hand You must make them understand I tell you my lord the darkness is coming There are wild things in the woods direwolves and mammoths and snow bears the size of aurochs and I have seen darker shapes in my dreams

In your dreams Tyrion echoed thinking how badly he needed another strong drink

Mormont was deaf to the edge in his voice The fisherfolk near Eastwatch have glimpsed white walkers on the shore

This time Tyrion could not hold his tongue The fisherfolk of Lannisport often glimpse merlings

Denys Mallister writes that the mountain people are moving south slipping past the Shadow Tower in numbers greater than ever before They are running my lord… but running from what Lord Mormont moved to the window and stared out into the night These are old bones Lannister but they have never felt a chill like this Tell the king what I say I pray you Winter is coming and when the Long Night falls only the Night’s Watch will stand between the realm and the darkness that sweeps from the north The gods help us all if we are not ready

The gods help me if I do not get some sleep tonight Yoren is determined to ride at first light Tyrion got to his feet sleepy from wine and tired of doom I thank you for all the courtesies you have done me Lord Mormont

Tell them Tyrion Tell them and make them believe That is all the thanks I need He whistled and his raven flew to him and perched on his shoulder Mormont smiled and gave the bird some corn from his pocket and that was how Tyrion left him

It was bitter cold outside Bundled thickly in his furs Tyrion Lannister pulled on his gloves and nodded to the poor frozen wretches standing sentry outside the Commander’s Keep He set off across the yard for his own chambers in the King’s Tower walking as briskly as his legs could manage Patches of snow crunched beneath his feet as his boots broke the night’s crust and his breath steamed before him like a banner He shoved his hands into his armpits and walked faster praying that Morrec had remembered to warm his bed with hot bricks from the fire

Behind the King’s Tower the Wall glimmered in the light of the moon immense and mysterious Tyrion stopped for a moment to look up at it His legs ached of cold and haste

Suddenly a strange madness took hold of him a yearning to look once more off the end of the world It would be his last chance he thought tomorrow he would ride south and he could not imagine why he would ever want to return to this frozen desolation The King’s Tower was before him with its promise of warmth and a soft bed yet Tyrion found himself walking past it toward the vast pale palisade of the Wall

A wooden stair ascended the south face anchored on huge rough-hewn beams sunk deep into the ice and frozen in place Back and forth it switched clawing its way upward as crooked as a bolt of lightning The black brothers assured him that it was much stronger than it looked but Tyrion’s legs were cramping too badly for him to even contemplate the ascent He went instead to the iron cage beside the well clambered inside and yanked hard on the bell rope three quick pulls

He had to wait what seemed an eternity standing there inside the bars with the Wall to his back Long enough for Tyrion to begin to wonder why he was doing this He had just about decided to forget his sudden whim and go to bed when the cage gave a jerk and began to ascend

He moved upward slowly by fits and starts at first then more smoothly The ground fell away beneath him the cage swung and Tyrion wrapped his hands around the iron bars He could feel the cold of the metal even through his gloves Morrec had a fire burning in his room he noted with approval but the Lord Commander’s tower was dark The Old Bear had more sense than he did it seemed

Then he was above the towers still inching his way upward Castle Black lay below him etched in moonlight You could see how stark and empty it was from up here windowless keeps crumbling walls courtyards choked with broken stone Farther off he could see the lights of Mole’s Town the little village half a league south along the kingsroad and here and there the bright glitter of moonlight on water where icy streams descended from the mountain heights to cut across the plains The rest of the world was a bleak emptiness of windswept hills and rocky fields spotted with snow

Finally a thick voice behind him said Seven hells it’s the dwarf and the cage jerked to a sudden stop and hung there swinging slowly back and forth the ropes creaking

Bring him in damn it There was a grunt and a loud groaning of wood as the cage slid sideways and then the Wall was beneath him Tyrion waited until the swinging had stopped before he pushed open the cage door and hopped down onto the ice A heavy figure in black was leaning on the winch while a second held the cage with a gloved hand Their faces were muffled in woolen scarves so only their eyes showed and they were plump with layers of wool and leather black on black And what will you be wanting this time of night the one by the winch asked

A last look

The men exchanged sour glances Look all you want the other one said Just have a care you don’t fall off little man The Old Bear would have our hides A small wooden shack stood under the great crane and Tyrion saw the dull glow of a brazier and felt a brief gust of warmth when the winch men opened the door and went back inside And then he was alone

It was bitingly cold up here and the wind pulled at his clothes like an insistent lover The top of the Wall was wider than the kingsroad often was so Tyrion had no fear of falling although the footing was slicker than he would have liked The brothers spread crushed stone across the walkways but the weight of countless footsteps would melt the Wall beneath so the ice would seem to grow around the gravel swallowing it until the path was bare again and it was time to crush more stone

Still it was nothing that Tyrion could not manage He looked off to the east and west at the Wall stretching before him a vast white road with no beginning and no end and a dark abyss on either side West he decided for no special reason and he began to walk that way following the pathway nearest the north edge where the gravel looked freshest

His bare cheeks were ruddy with the cold and his legs complained more loudly with every step but Tyrion ignored them The wind swirled around him gravel crunched beneath his boots while ahead the white ribbon followed the lines of the hills rising higher and higher until it was lost beyond the western horizon He passed a massive catapult as tall as a city wall its base sunk deep into the Wall The throwing arm had been taken off for repairs and then forgotten it lay there like a broken toy half-embedded in the ice

On the far side of the catapult a muffled voice called out a challenge Who goes there Halt

Tyrion stopped If I halt too long I’ll freeze in place Jon he said as a shaggy pale shape slid toward him silently and sniffed at his furs Hello Ghost

Jon Snow moved closer He looked bigger and heavier in his layers of fur and leather the hood of his cloak pulled down over his face Lannister he said yanking loose the scarf to uncover his mouth This is the last place I would have expected to see you He carried a heavy spear tipped in iron taller than he was and a sword hung at his side in a leather sheath Across his chest was a gleaming black warhorn banded with silver

This is the last place I would have expected to be seen Tyrion admitted I was captured by a whim If I touch Ghost will he chew my hand off

Not with me here Jon promised

Tyrion scratched the white wolf behind the ears The red eyes watched him impassively The beast came up as high as his chest now Another year and Tyrion had the gloomy feeling he’d be looking up at him What are you doing up here tonight he asked Besides freezing your manhood off…

I have drawn night guard Jon said Again Ser Alliser has kindly arranged for the watch commander to take a special interest in me He seems to think that if they keep me awake half the night I’ll fall asleep during morning drill So far I have disappointed him

Tyrion grinned And has Ghost learned to juggle yet

No said Jon smiling but Grenn held his own against Halder this morning and Pyp is no longer dropping his sword quite so often as he did

Pyp

Pypar is his real name The small boy with the large ears He saw me working with Grenn and asked for help Thorne had never even shown him the proper way to grip a sword He turned to look north I have a mile of Wall to guard Will you walk with me

If you walk slowly Tyrion said

The watch commander tells me I must walk to keep my blood from freezing but he never said how fast

They walked with Ghost pacing along beside Jon like a white shadow I leave on the morrow Tyrion said

I know Jon sounded strangely sad

I plan to stop at Winterfell on the way south If there is any message that you would like me to deliver…

Tell Robb that I’m going to command the Night’s Watch and keep him safe so he might as well take up needlework with the girls and have Mikken melt down his sword for horseshoes

Your brother is bigger than me Tyrion said with a laugh I decline to deliver any message that might get me killed

Rickon will ask when I’m coming home Try to explain where I’ve gone if you can Tell him he can have all my things while I’m away he’ll like that

People seemed to be asking a great deal of him today Tyrion Lannister thought You could put all this in a letter you know

Rickon can’t read yet Bran… He stopped suddenly I don’t know what message to send to Bran Help him Tyrion

What help could I give him I am no maester to ease his pain I have no spells to give him back his legs

You gave me help when I needed it Jon Snow said

I gave you nothing Tyrion said Words

Then give your words to Bran too

You’re asking a lame man to teach a cripple how to dance Tyrion said However sincere the lesson the result is likely to be grotesque Still I know what it is to love a brother Lord Snow I will give Bran whatever small help is in my power

Thank you my lord of Lannister He pulled off his glove and offered his bare hand Friend
