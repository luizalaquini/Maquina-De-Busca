for I was but a little displeased and they helped forward the
affliction

116 Therefore thus saith the LORD I am returned to Jerusalem with
mercies my house shall be built in it saith the LORD of hosts and a
line shall be stretched forth upon Jerusalem

117 Cry yet saying Thus saith the LORD of hosts My cities through
prosperity shall yet be spread abroad and the LORD shall yet comfort
Zion and shall yet choose Jerusalem

118 Then lifted I up mine eyes and saw and behold four horns

119 And I said unto the angel that talked with me What be these And
he answered me These are the horns which have scattered Judah
Israel and Jerusalem

120 And the LORD shewed me four carpenters

121 Then said I What come these to do And he spake saying These
are the horns which have scattered Judah so that no man did lift up
his head but these are come to fray them to cast out the horns of
the Gentiles which lifted up their horn over the land of Judah to
scatter it

21 I lifted up mine eyes again and looked and behold a man with a
measuring line in his hand

22 Then said I Whither goest thou And he said unto me To measure
Jerusalem to see what is the breadth thereof and what is the length
thereof

23 And behold the angel that talked with me went forth and another
angel went out to meet him 24 And said unto him Run speak to this
young man saying Jerusalem shall be inhabited as towns without walls
for the multitude of men and cattle therein 25 For I saith the
LORD will be unto her a wall of fire round about and will be the
glory in the midst of her

26 Ho ho come forth and flee from the land of the north saith the
LORD for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heaven
saith the LORD

27 Deliver thyself O Zion that dwellest with the daughter of
Babylon

28 For thus saith the LORD of hosts After the glory hath he sent me
unto the nations which spoiled you for he that toucheth you toucheth
the apple of his eye

29 For behold I will shake mine hand upon them and they shall be a
spoil to their servants and ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath
sent me

210 Sing and rejoice O daughter of Zion for lo I come and I will
dwell in the midst of thee saith the LORD

211 And many nations shall be joined to the LORD in that day and
shall be my people and I will dwell in the midst of thee and thou
shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto thee

212 And the LORD shall inherit Judah his portion in the holy land
and shall choose Jerusalem again

213 Be silent O all flesh before the LORD for he is raised up out
of his holy habitation

31 And he shewed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel
of the LORD and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him

32 And the LORD said unto Satan The LORD rebuke thee O Satan even
the LORD that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee is not this a brand
plucked out of the fire  33 Now Joshua was clothed with filthy
garments and stood before the angel

34 And he answered and spake unto those that stood before him
saying Take away the filthy garments from him And unto him he said
Behold I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee and I will
clothe thee with change of raiment

35 And I said Let them set a fair mitre upon his head So they set a
fair mitre upon his head and clothed him with garments And the angel
of the LORD stood by

36 And the angel of the LORD protested unto Joshua saying 37 Thus
saith the LORD of hosts If thou wilt walk in my ways and if thou
wilt keep my charge then thou shalt also judge my house and shalt
also keep my courts and I will give thee places to walk among these
that stand by

38 Hear now O Joshua the high priest thou and thy fellows that sit
before thee for they are men wondered at for behold I will bring
forth my servant the BRANCH

39 For behold the stone that I have laid before Joshua upon one
stone shall be seven eyes behold I will engrave the graving thereof
saith the LORD of hosts and I will remove the iniquity of that land
in one day

310 In that day saith the LORD of hosts shall ye call every man his
