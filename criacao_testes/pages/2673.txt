815 And David reigned over all Israel and David executed judgment
and justice unto all his people

816 And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host and Jehoshaphat
the son of Ahilud was recorder 817 And Zadok the son of Ahitub and
Ahimelech the son of Abiathar were the priests and Seraiah was the
scribe 818 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over both the
Cherethites and the Pelethites and Davids sons were chief rulers

91 And David said Is there yet any that is left of the house of
Saul that I may shew him kindness for Jonathans sake  92 And there
was of the house of Saul a servant whose name was Ziba And when they
had called him unto David the king said unto him Art thou Ziba  And
he said Thy servant is he

93 And the king said Is there not yet any of the house of Saul that
I may shew the kindness of God unto him And Ziba said unto the king
Jonathan hath yet a son which is lame on his feet

94 And the king said unto him Where is he And Ziba said unto the
king Behold he is in the house of Machir the son of Ammiel in
Lodebar

95 Then king David sent and fetched him out of the house of Machir
the son of Ammiel from Lodebar

96 Now when Mephibosheth the son of Jonathan the son of Saul was
come unto David he fell on his face and did reverence And David
said Mephibosheth And he answered Behold thy servant  97 And
David said unto him Fear not for I will surely shew thee kindness
for Jonathan thy fathers sake and will restore thee all the land of
Saul thy father and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually

98 And he bowed himself and said What is thy servant that thou
shouldest look upon such a dead dog as I am  99 Then the king called
to Ziba Sauls servant and said unto him I have given unto thy
masters son all that pertained to Saul and to all his house

910 Thou therefore and thy sons and thy servants shall till the
land for him and thou shalt bring in the fruits that thy masters
son may have food to eat but Mephibosheth thy masters son shall eat
bread alway at my table Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty
servants

911 Then said Ziba unto the king According to all that my lord the
king hath commanded his servant so shall thy servant do As for
Mephibosheth said the king he shall eat at my table as one of the
kings sons

912 And Mephibosheth had a young son whose name was Micha And all
that dwelt in the house of Ziba were servants unto Mephibosheth

913 So Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem for he did eat continually at
the kings table and was lame on both his feet

101 And it came to pass after this that the king of the children of
Ammon died and Hanun his son reigned in his stead

102 Then said David I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of
Nahash as his father shewed kindness unto me And David sent to
comfort him by the hand of his servants for his father And Davids
servants came into the land of the children of Ammon

103 And the princes of the children of Ammon said unto Hanun their
lord Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father that he hath
sent comforters unto thee hath not David rather sent his servants
unto thee to search the city and to spy it out and to overthrow it
104 Wherefore Hanun took Davids servants and shaved off the one
half of their beards and cut off their garments in the middle even
to their buttocks and sent them away

105 When they told it unto David he sent to meet them because the
men were greatly ashamed and the king said Tarry at Jericho until
your beards be grown and then return

106 And when the children of Ammon saw that they stank before David
the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Bethrehob and the
Syrians of Zoba twenty thousand footmen and of king Maacah a
thousand men and of Ishtob twelve thousand men

107 And when David heard of it he sent Joab and all the host of the
mighty men

108 And the children of Ammon came out and put the battle in array
at the entering in of the gate and the Syrians of Zoba and of Rehob
and Ishtob and Maacah were by themselves in the field

109 When Joab saw that the front of the battle was against him before
and behind he chose of all the choice men of Israel and put them in
array against the Syrians 1010 And the rest of the people he
delivered into the hand of Abishai his brother that he might put them
in array against the children of Ammon

1011 And he said If the Syrians be too strong for me then thou
shalt help me but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee
then I will come and help thee

1012 Be of good courage and let us play the men for our people and
for the cities of our God and the LORD do that which seemeth him
good
