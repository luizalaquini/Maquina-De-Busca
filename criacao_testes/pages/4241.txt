carried out coldlyby
hirelings and a shadow seemed to move about the
rooms saying that the proceedings were unnatural to
the place and the lone man who lived therein and hence
not good
Bathsheba was at this time in her room dressing for
the event She had called for candles and Liddy
entered and placed one on each side of her mistresss
glass
Dont go away Liddy said Bathsheba almost
timidly I am foolishly agitated-i cannot tell why
I wish I had not been obliged to go to this dance but
theres no escaping now I have not spoken to Mr
Boldwood since the autumn when I promised to see
him at Christmas on business but I had no idea there
was to be anything of this kind
But I would go now said Liddy who was going
with her for Boldwood had been indiscriminate in his
invitations
Yes I shall make my appearance of course said
Bathsheba  But I am 1the cause1 of the party and that
upsets me -- Dont tell Liddy
O no maam You the cause of it maam 
Yes I am the reason of the party-i If it had
not been for me there would never have been one I
cant explain any more -- theres no more to be explained
I wish I had never seen Weatherbury
Thats wicked of you -- to wish to be worse off than
you are
No Liddy I have never been free from trouble
since I have lived here and this party is likely to bring
me more Now fetch my black silk dress and see how
it sits upon me
But you will leave off that surely maam You
have been a widowiady fourteen months and ought to
brighten up a little on such a night as this
Is it necessary No I will appear as usual for if
I were to wear any light dress people would say things
about me and I should seem to he rejoicing when I am
solemn all the time The party doesnt suit me a bit
but never mind stay and help to finish me off

Boldwood was dressing also at this hour A tailor
from Casterbridge was with him assisting him in the
operation of trying on a new coat that had just beem
brought home
Never had Boldwood been so fastidious unreasonable
about the fit and generally difficult to please The
tailor walked round and round him tugged at the waist
pulled the sleeve pressed out the collar and for the
first time in his experience Boldwood was not bored+
Times had been when the farmer had exclaimed against
all such niceties as childish but now no philosophic or
hasty rebuke whatever was provoked by this man for
attaching as much importance to a crease in the coat
as to an earthquake in South America Boldwood at
last expressed himself nearly satisfied and paid the bill
the tailor passing out of the door just as Oak came in
to report progress for the day
Oh Oak said Boldwood I shall of course see
you here to-night Make yourself merry I am deter+
mined that neither expense nor trouble shall be spared
Ill try to be here sir though perhaps it may not
be very early said Gabriel quietly I am glad indeed
to see such a change in ee from what it used to be
 Yes-i must own it-i am bright to-night  cheerful
and more than cheerfui-so much so that I am almost
sad again with the sense that all of it is passing away
And sometimes when I am excessively hopeful and
blithe a trouble is looming in the distance  so that I
often get to look upon gloom in me with content and
to fear a happy mood Still this may be absurd-i feel
that it is absurd Perhaps my day is dawning at last
I hope it ill be a long and a fair one
Thank you -- thank you Yet perhaps my cheerfui
mess rests on a slender hope And yet I trust my hope
It is faith not hope I think this time I reckon with
my host -- Oak my hands are a little shaky or some+
thing I cant tie this neckerchief properly Perhaps
you will tie it for me The fact is I have not been well
lately you know
I am sorry to hear that sir
P 421
Oh its nothing I want it done as well as you can
please Is there any late knot in fashion Oak
I dont know sir said Oak His tone had sunk to
sadness
Boldwood approached Gabriel and as Oak tied the
neckerchief the farmer went on feverishly --
Does a woman keep her promise Gabriel
If it is not inconvenient to her she may
 -- Or rather an implied promise
I wont answer for her implying said Oak with
faint bitterness Thats a word as full o holes as a
sieve with them
Oak dont talk like that You have got quite
cynical lately -- how is it We seem to have shifted our
positions I have become the young and hopeful man
