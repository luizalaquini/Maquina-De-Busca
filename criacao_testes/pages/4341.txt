Whenever data rates are reduced redundancy inherent in the signal is
necessarily lost and so the effect of transmission errors becomes
greatly magnified
For example a single corrupted sample in PCM transmission of speech
will probably not be noticed and even a short burst of errors will be
perceived as a click which can readily be distinguished from the speech
However any error in LPC transmission will last for one entire
frame em say 20 msec em and worse still it will be integrated into the
speech signal and not easily discriminated from it by the listeners brain
A single corruption may for example change a voiced frame into an
unvoiced one or vice versa  Even if it affects only 
a reflection coefficient it will change the resonance characteristics
of that frame and change them in a way that does not simply sound like
superimposed noise

FG Table 61  Bit requirements for each parameter in LPC-10 coding scheme
Different coding is used for voiced and unvoiced frames
Only four reflection coefficients are transmitted for unvoiced frames
because it has been determined that no perceptible increase in speech quality
occurs when more are used
The bits saved are more fruitfully employed to provide error detection
and correction for the other parameters
Seven bits are used for pitch and the voiced-unvoiced flag and they are
redundant in that only 60 possible pitch values are
allowed
Most transmission errors in this field will be detected by the receiver
which can then use an estimate of pitch based on previous values and
discard the erroneous one  Pitch values are also Gray coded so that
even if errors are not detected there is a good chance that an adjacent
pitch value is read instead
Different numbers of bits are allocated to the various reflection
coefficients  experience shows that the lower-numbered ones contribute
most highly to intelligibility and so these are quantized most finely
In addition a table lookup operation is performed on the code
generated for the first two providing a non-linear quantization which is
chosen to minimize the error on a statistical basis

With 54 bitsframe and 225 msec frames LPC-10 requires a 2400 bits
data rate  Even lower rates have been used successfully for lower-quality
speech  The Speak n Spell toy described in Chapter 11 has an
average data rate of 1200 bits  Rates as low as 600 bits have
been achieved Kang and Coulter 1976 by pattern recognition techniques operating
on the reflection coefficients  however the speech quality is not good
