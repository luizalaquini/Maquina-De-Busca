So are you Jon told her I had Mikken make this special The bravos use swords like this in Pentos and Myr and the other Free Cities It won’t hack a man’s head off but it can poke him full of holes if you’re fast enough

I can be fast Arya said

You’ll have to work at it every day He put the sword in her hands showed her how to hold it and stepped back How does it feel Do you like the balance

I think so Arya said

First lesson Jon said Stick them with the pointy end

Arya gave him a whap on the arm with the flat of her blade The blow stung but Jon found himself grinning like an idiot I know which end to use Arya said A doubtful look crossed her face Septa Mordane will take it away from me

Not if she doesn’t know you have it Jon said

Who will I practice with

You’ll find someone Jon promised her King’s Landing is a true city a thousand times the size of Winterfell Until you find a partner watch how they fight in the yard Run and ride make yourself strong And whatever you do…

Arya knew what was coming next They said it together

…don’t… tell… Sansa

Jon messed up her hair I will miss you little sister

Suddenly she looked like she was going to cry I wish you were coming with us

Different roads sometimes lead to the same castle Who knows He was feeling better now He was not going to let himself be sad I better go I’ll spend my first year on the Wall emptying chamber pots if I keep Uncle Ben waiting any longer

Arya ran to him for a last hug Put down the sword first Jon warned her laughing She set it aside almost shyly and showered him with kisses

When he turned back at the door she was holding it again trying it for balance I almost forgot he told her All the best swords have names

Like Ice she said She looked at the blade in her hand Does this have a name Oh tell me

Can’t you guess Jon teased Your very favorite thing

Arya seemed puzzled at first Then it came to her She was that quick They said it together

Needle

The memory of her laughter warmed him on the long ride north





DAENERYS

Daenerys Targaryen wed Khal Drogo with fear and barbaric splendor in a field beyond the walls of Pentos for the Dothraki believed that all things of importance in a man’s life must be done beneath the open sky

Drogo had called his khalasar to attend him and they had come forty thousand Dothraki warriors and uncounted numbers of women children and slaves Outside the city walls they camped with their vast herds raising palaces of woven grass eating everything in sight and making the good folk of Pentos more anxious with every passing day

My fellow magisters have doubled the size of the city guard Illyrio told them over platters of honey duck and orange snap peppers one night at the manse that had been Drogo’s The khal had joined his khalasar his estate given over to Daenerys and her brother until the wedding
