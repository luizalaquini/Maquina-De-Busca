163 Shall vain words have an end or what emboldeneth thee that thou
answerest  164 I also could speak as ye do if your soul were in my
souls stead I could heap up words against you and shake mine head
at you

165 But I would strengthen you with my mouth and the moving of my
lips should asswage your grief

166 Though I speak my grief is not asswaged and though I forbear
what am I eased  167 But now he hath made me weary thou hast made
desolate all my company

168 And thou hast filled me with wrinkles which is a witness against
me and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face

169 He teareth me in his wrath who hateth me he gnasheth upon me
with his teeth mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me

1610 They have gaped upon me with their mouth they have smitten me
upon the cheek reproachfully they have gathered themselves together
against me

1611 God hath delivered me to the ungodly and turned me over into
the hands of the wicked

1612 I was at ease but he hath broken me asunder he hath also taken
me by my neck and shaken me to pieces and set me up for his mark

1613 His archers compass me round about he cleaveth my reins
asunder and doth not spare he poureth out my gall upon the ground

1614 He breaketh me with breach upon breach he runneth upon me like
a giant

1615 I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin and defiled my horn in the
dust

1616 My face is foul with weeping and on my eyelids is the shadow of
death 1617 Not for any injustice in mine hands also my prayer is
pure

1618 O earth cover not thou my blood and let my cry have no place

1619 Also now behold my witness is in heaven and my record is on
high

1620 My friends scorn me but mine eye poureth out tears unto God

1621 O that one might plead for a man with God as a man pleadeth for
his neighbour  1622 When a few years are come then I shall go the
way whence I shall not return

171 My breath is corrupt my days are extinct the graves are ready
for me

172 Are there not mockers with me and doth not mine eye continue in
their provocation  173 Lay down now put me in a surety with thee
who is he that will strike hands with me  174 For thou hast hid
their heart from understanding therefore shalt thou not exalt them

175 He that speaketh flattery to his friends even the eyes of his
children shall fail

176 He hath made me also a byword of the people and aforetime I was
as a tabret

177 Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow and all my members are
as a shadow

178 Upright men shall be astonied at this and the innocent shall
stir up himself against the hypocrite

179 The righteous also shall hold on his way and he that hath clean
hands shall be stronger and stronger

1710 But as for you all do ye return and come now for I cannot
find one wise man among you

1711 My days are past my purposes are broken off even the thoughts
of my heart

1712 They change the night into day the light is short because of
darkness

1713 If I wait the grave is mine house I have made my bed in the
darkness

1714 I have said to corruption Thou art my father to the worm Thou
art my mother and my sister

1715 And where is now my hope as for my hope who shall see it
1716 They shall go down to the bars of the pit when our rest
together is in the dust

181 Then answered Bildad the Shuhite and said 182 How long will it
be ere ye make an end of words mark and afterwards we will speak

183 Wherefore are we counted as beasts and reputed vile in your
sight  184 He teareth himself in his anger shall the earth be
forsaken for thee and shall the rock be removed out of his place
