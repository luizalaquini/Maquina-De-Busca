Truly my prince the girl replied so consider well

Bran tried to think it through the way his father might have The Greatjon’s uncles Hother Whoresbane and Mors Crowfood were fierce men but he thought they would be loyal And the Karstarks them too Karhold was a strong castle Father always said We would be safe with the Umbers or the Karstarks

Or they could go south to fat Lord Manderly At Winterfell he’d laughed a lot and never seemed to look at Bran with so much pity as the other lords Castle Cerwyn was closer than White Harbor but Maester Luwin had said that Cley Cerwyn was dead The Umbers and the Karstarks and the Manderlys may all be dead as well he realized As he would be if he was caught by the ironmen or the Bastard of Bolton

If they stayed here hidden down beneath Tumbledown Tower no one would find them He would stay alive And crippled

Bran realized he was crying Stupid baby he thought at himself No matter where he went to Karhold or White Harbor or Greywater Watch he’d be a cripple when he got there He balled his hands into fists I want to fly he told them Please Take me to the crow





Davos


When he came up on deck the long point of Driftmark was dwindling behind them while Dragonstone rose from the sea ahead A pale grey wisp of smoke blew from the top of the mountain to mark where the island lay Dragonmont is restless this morning Davos thought or else Melisandre is burning someone else

Melisandre had been much in his thoughts as Shayala’s Dance made her way across Blackwater Bay and through the Gullet tacking against perverse contrary winds The great fire that burned atop the Sharp Point watchtower at the end of Massey’s Hook reminded him of the ruby she wore at her throat and when the world turned red at dawn and sunset the drifting clouds turned the same color as the silks and satins of her rustling gowns

She would be waiting on Dragonstone as well waiting in all her beauty and all her power with her god and her shadows and his king The red priestess had always seemed loyal to Stannis until now She has broken him as a man breaks a horse She would ride him to power if she could and for that she gave my sons to the fire I will cut the living heart from her breast and see how it burns He touched the hilt of the fine long Lysene dirk that the captain had given him

The captain had been very kind to him His name was Khorane Sathmantes a Lyseni like Salladhor Saan whose ship this was He had the pale blue eyes you often saw on Lys set in a bony weatherworn face but he had spent many years trading in the Seven Kingdoms When he learned that the man he had plucked from the sea was the celebrated onion knight he gave him the use of his own cabin and his own clothes and a pair of new boots that almost fit He insisted that Davos share his provisions as well though that turned out badly His stomach could not tolerate the snails and lampreys and other rich food Captain Khorane so relished and after his first meal at the captain’s table he spent the rest of the day with one end or the other dangling over the rail

Dragonstone loomed larger with every stroke of the oars Davos could see the shape of the mountain now and on its side the great black citadel with its gargoyles and dragon towers The bronze figurehead at the bow of Shayala’s Dance sent up wings of salt spray as it cut the waves He leaned his weight against the rail grateful for its support His ordeal had weakened him If he stood too long his legs shook and sometimes he fell prey to uncontrollable fits of coughing and brought up gobs of bloody phlegm It is nothing he told himself Surely the gods did not bring me safe through flre and sea only to kill me with a flux

As he listened to the pounding of the oarmaster’s drum the thrum of the sail and the rhythmic swish and creak of the oars he thought back to his younger days when these same sounds woke dread in his heart on many a misty morn They heralded the approach of old Ser Tristimun’s sea watch and the sea watch was death to smugglers when Aerys Targaryen sat the Iron Throne

But that was another lifetime he thought That was before the onion ship before Storm’s End before Stannis shortened my fingers That was before the war or the red comet before I was a Seaworth or a knight I was a different man in those days before Lord Stannis raised me high

Captain Khorane had told him of the end of Stannis’s hopes on the night the river burned The Lannisters had taken him from the flank and his fickle bannermen had abandoned him by the hundreds in the hour of his greatest need King Renly’s shade was seen as well the captain said slaying right and left as he led the lion lord’s van It’s said his green armor took a ghostly glow from the wildfire and his antlers ran with golden flames

Renly’s shade Davos wondered if his sons would return as shades as well He had seen too many queer things on the sea to say that ghosts did not exist Did none keep faith he asked

Some few the captain said The queen’s kin them in chief We took off many who wore the fox-and-flowers though many more were left ashore with all manner of badges Lord Florent is the King’s Hand on Dragonstone now

The mountain grew taller crowned all in pale smoke The sail sang the drum beat the oars pulled smoothly and before very long the mouth of the harbor opened before them So empty Davos thought remembering how it had been before with the ships crowding every quay and rocking at anchor off the breakwater He could see Salladhor Saan’s flagship Valyrian moored at the quay where Fury and her sisters had once tied up The ships on either side of her had striped Lysene hulls as well In vain he looked for any sign of Lady Marya or Wraith

They pulled down the sail as they entered the harbor to dock on oars alone The captain came to Davos as they were tying up My prince will wish to see you at once

A fit of coughing seized Davos as he tried to answer He clutched the rail for support and spat over the side The king he wheezed I must go to the king For where the king is I will find Melisandre

No one goes to the king Khorane Sathmantes replied firmly Salladhor Saan will tell you Him first

Davos was too weak to defy him He could only nod

Salladhor Saan was not aboard his Valyrian They found him at another quay a quarter mile distant down in the hold of a big-bellied Pentoshi cog named Bountiful Harvest counting cargo with two eunuchs One held a lantern the other a wax tablet and stylus Thirty-seven thirty-eight thirty-nine the old rogue was saying when Davos and the captain came down the hatch Today he wore a wine-colored tunic and high boots of bleached white leather inlaid with silver scrollwork Pulling the stopper from a jar he sniffed sneezed and said A coarse grind and of the second quality my nose declares The bill of lading is saying forty-three jars Where have the others gotten to I am wondering These Pentoshi do they think I am not counting When he saw Davos he stopped suddenly Is it pepper stinging my eyes or tears Is this the knight of the onions who stands before me No how can it be my dear friend Davos died on the burning river all agree Why has he come to haunt me

I am no ghost Salla

What else My onion knight was never so thin or so pale as you Salladhor Saan threaded his way between the jars of spice and bolts of cloth that filled the hold of the merchanter wrapped Davos in a fierce embrace then kissed him once on each cheek and a third time on his forehead You are still warm ser and I feel your heart thumpety-thumping Can it be true The sea that swallowed you has spit you up again

Davos was reminded of Patchface Princess Shireen’s lackwit fool He had gone into the sea as well and when he came out he was mad Am I mad as well He coughed into a gloved hand and said I swam beneath the chain and washed ashore on a spear of the merling king I would have died there if Shayala’s Dance had not come upon me
