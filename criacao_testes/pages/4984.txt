that it is not sown nor beareth nor any grass groweth therein like
the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah Admah and Zeboim which the
LORD overthrew in his anger and in his wrath 2924 Even all nations
shall say Wherefore hath the LORD done thus unto this land what
meaneth the heat of this great anger  2925 Then men shall say
Because they have forsaken the covenant of the LORD God of their
fathers which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the
land of Egypt 2926 For they went and served other gods and
worshipped them gods whom they knew not and whom he had not given
unto them 2927 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against this
land to bring upon it all the curses that are written in this book
2928 And the LORD rooted them out of their land in anger and in
wrath and in great indignation and cast them into another land as
it is this day

2929 The secret things belong unto the LORD our God but those things
which are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever that
we may do all the words of this law

301 And it shall come to pass when all these things are come upon
thee the blessing and the curse which I have set before thee and
thou shalt call them to mind among all the nations whither the LORD
thy God hath driven thee 302 And shalt return unto the LORD thy God
and shalt obey his voice according to all that I command thee this
day thou and thy children with all thine heart and with all thy
soul 303 That then the LORD thy God will turn thy captivity and
have compassion upon thee and will return and gather thee from all
the nations whither the LORD thy God hath scattered thee

304 If any of thine be driven out unto the outmost parts of heaven
from thence will the LORD thy God gather thee and from thence will he
fetch thee 305 And the LORD thy God will bring thee into the land
which thy fathers possessed and thou shalt possess it and he will do
thee good and multiply thee above thy fathers

306 And the LORD thy God will circumcise thine heart and the heart
of thy seed to love the LORD thy God with all thine heart and with
all thy soul that thou mayest live

307 And the LORD thy God will put all these curses upon thine
enemies and on them that hate thee which persecuted thee

308 And thou shalt return and obey the voice of the LORD and do all
his commandments which I command thee this day

309 And the LORD thy God will make thee plenteous in every work of
thine hand in the fruit of thy body and in the fruit of thy cattle
and in the fruit of thy land for good for the LORD will again
rejoice over thee for good as he rejoiced over thy fathers 3010 If
thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God to keep his
commandments and his statutes which are written in this book of the
law and if thou turn unto the LORD thy God with all thine heart and
with all thy soul

3011 For this commandment which I command thee this day it is not
hidden from thee neither is it far off

3012 It is not in heaven that thou shouldest say Who shall go up
for us to heaven and bring it unto us that we may hear it and do
it  3013 Neither is it beyond the sea that thou shouldest say Who
shall go over the sea for us and bring it unto us that we may hear
it and do it  3014 But the word is very nigh unto thee in thy
mouth and in thy heart that thou mayest do it

3015 See I have set before thee this day life and good and death
and evil 3016 In that I command thee this day to love the LORD thy
God to walk in his ways and to keep his commandments and his
statutes and his judgments that thou mayest live and multiply and
the LORD thy God shall bless thee in the land whither thou goest to
possess it

3017 But if thine heart turn away so that thou wilt not hear but
shalt be drawn away and worship other gods and serve them 3018 I
denounce unto you this day that ye shall surely perish and that ye
shall not prolong your days upon the land whither thou passest over
Jordan to go to possess it

3019 I call heaven and earth to record this day against you that I
have set before you life and death blessing and cursing therefore
choose life that both thou and thy seed may live 3020 That thou
mayest love the LORD thy God and that thou mayest obey his voice and
that thou mayest cleave unto him for he is thy life and the length
of thy days that thou mayest dwell in the land which the LORD sware
unto thy fathers to Abraham to Isaac and to Jacob to give them

311 And Moses went and spake these words unto all Israel

312 And he said unto them I am an hundred and twenty years old this
day I can no more go out and come in also the LORD hath said unto
me Thou shalt not go over this Jordan

313 The LORD thy God he will go over before thee and he will
destroy these nations from before thee and thou shalt possess them
and Joshua he shall go over before thee as the LORD hath said

314 And the LORD shall do unto them as he did to Sihon and to Og
kings of the Amorites and unto the land of them whom he destroyed

315 And the LORD shall give them up before your face that ye may do
unto them according unto all the commandments which I have commanded
