Then I’ll take as much gold as I can carry laugh in his face and ride off If he doesn’t take me he’d be wise to kill me but he won’t Too much his father’s son from what I hear Fine with me Either way I win And so do you she-wolf So stop whimpering and snapping at me I’m sick of it Keep your mouth shut and do as I tell you and maybe we’ll even be in time for your uncle’s bloody wedding





Jon


The mare was blown but Jon could not let up on her He had to reach the Wall before the Magnar He would have slept in the saddle if he’d had one lacking that it was hard enough to stay ahorse while awake His wounded leg grew ever more painful He dare not rest long enough to let it heal Instead he ripped it open anew each time he mounted up

When he crested a rise and saw the brown rutted kingsroad before him wending its way north through hill and plain he patted the mare’s neck and said Now all we need do is follow the road girl Soon the Wall His leg had gone as stiff as wood by then and fever had made him so light-headed that twice he found himself riding in the wrong direction

Soon the Wall He pictured his friends drinking mulled wine in the common hall Hobb would be with his kettles Donal Noye at his forge Maester Aemon in his rooms beneath the rookery And the Old Bear Sam Grenn Dolorous Edd Dywen with his wooden teeth… Jon could only pray that some had escaped the Fist

Ygritte was much in his thoughts as well He remembered the smell of her hair the warmth of her body… and the look on her face as she slit the old man’s throat You were wrong to love her a voice whispered You were wrong to leave her a different voice insisted He wondered if his father had been torn the same way when he’d left Jon’s mother to return to Lady Catelyn He was pledged to Lady Stark and I am pledged to the Night’s Watch

He almost rode through Mole’s Town so feverish that he did not know where he was Most of the village was hidden underground only a handful of small hovels to be seen by the light of the waning moon The brothel was a shed no bigger than a privy its red lantern creaking in the wind a bloodshot eye peering through the blackness Jon dismounted at the adjoining stable half-stumbling from the mare’s back as he shouted two boys awake I need a fresh mount with saddle and bridle he told them in a tone that brooked no argument They brought him that a skin of wine as well and half a loaf of brown bread Wake the village he told them Warn them There are wildlings south of the Wall Gather your goods and make for Castle Black He pulled himself onto the black gelding they’d given him gritting his teeth at the pain in his leg and rode hard for the north

As the stars began to fade in the eastern sky the Wall appeared before him rising above the trees and the morning mists Moonlight glimmered pale against the ice He urged the gelding on following the muddy slick road until he saw the stone towers and timbered halls of Castle Black huddled like broken toys beneath the great cliff of ice By then the Wall glowed pink and purple with the first light of dawn

No sentries challenged him as he rode past the outbuildings No one came forth to bar his way Castle Black seemed as much a ruin as Greyguard Brown brittle weeds grew between cracks in the stones of the courtyards Old snow covered the roof of the Flint Barracks and lay in drifts against the north side of Hardin’s Tower where Jon used to sleep before being made the Old Bear’s steward Fingers of soot streaked the Lord Commander’s Tower where the smoke had boiled from the windows Mormont had moved to the King’s Tower after the fire but Jon saw no lights there either From the ground he could not tell if there were sentries walking the Wall seven hundred feet above but he saw no one on the huge switchback stair that climbed the south face of the ice like some great wooden thunderbolt

There was smoke rising from the chimney of the armory though only a wisp almost invisible against the grey northern sky but it was enough Jon dismounted and limped toward it Warmth poured out the open door like the hot breath of summer Within one-armed Donal Noye was working his bellows at the fire He looked up at the noise Jon Snow

None else Despite fever exhaustion his leg the Magnar the old man Ygritte Mance despite it all Jon smiled It was good to be back good to see Noye with his big belly and pinned-up sleeve his jaw bristling with black stubble

The smith released his grip on the bellows Your face…

He had almost forgotten about his face A skinchanger tried to rip out my eye

Noye frowned Scarred or smooth it’s a face I thought I’d seen the last of We heard you’d gone over to Mance Rayder

Jon grasped the door to stay upright Who told you that

Jarman Buckwell He returned a fortnight past His scouts claim they saw you with their own eyes riding along beside the wildling column and wearing a sheepskin cloak Noye eyed him I see the last part’s true

It’s all true Jon confessed As far as it goes

Should I be pulling down a sword to gut you then

No I was acting on orders Qhorin Halfhand’s last command Noye where is the garrison

Defending the Wall against your wildling friends

Yes but where

Everywhere Harma Dogshead was seen at Woodswatch-by-the-Pool Rattleshirt at Long Barrow the Weeper near Icemark All along the Wall… they’re here they’re there they’re climbing near Queensgate they’re hacking at the gates of Greyguard they’re massing against Eastwatch… but one glimpse of a black cloak and they’re gone Next day they’re somewhere else

Jon swallowed a groan Feints Mance wants us to spread ourselves thin don’t you see And Bowen Marsh has obliged him The gate is here The attack is here

Noye crossed the room Your leg is drenched in blood

Jon looked down dully It was true His wound had opened again An arrow wound…
