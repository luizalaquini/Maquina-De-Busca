Varys gave him a sorrowful look I fear Lord Renly has left the city

Left the city Ned had counted on Renly’s support

He took his leave through a postern gate an hour before dawn accompanied by Ser Loras Tyrell and some fifty retainers Varys told them When last seen they were galloping south in some haste no doubt bound for Storm’s End or Highgarden

So much for Renly and his hundred swords Ned did not like the smell of that but there was nothing to be done for it He drew out Robert’s last letter The king called me to his side last night and commanded me to record his final words Lord Renly and Grand Maester Pycelle stood witness as Robert sealed the letter to be opened by the council after his death Ser Barristan if you would be so kind

The Lord Commander of the Kingsguard examined the paper King Robert’s seal and unbroken He opened the letter and read Lord Eddard Stark is herein named Protector of the Realm to rule as regent until the heir comes of age

And as it happens he is of age Ned reflected but he did not give voice to the thought He trusted neither Pycelle nor Varys and Ser Barristan was honor-bound to protect and defend the boy he thought his new king The old knight would not abandon Joffrey easily The need for deceit was a bitter taste in his mouth but Ned knew he must tread softly here must keep his counsel and play the game until he was firmly established as regent There would be time enough to deal with the succession when Arya and Sansa were safely back in Winterfell and Lord Stannis had returned to King’s Landing with all his power

I would ask this council to confirm me as Lord Protector as Robert wished Ned said watching their faces wondering what thoughts hid behind Pycelle’s half-closed eyes Littlefinger’s lazy half-smile and the nervous flutter of Varys’s fingers

The door opened Fat Tom stepped into the solar Pardon my lords the king’s steward insists…

The royal steward entered and bowed Esteemed lords the king demands the immediate presence of his small council in the throne room

Ned had expected Cersei to strike quickly the summons came as no surprise The king is dead he said but we shall go with you nonetheless Tom assemble an escort if you would

Littlefinger gave Ned his arm to help him down the steps Varys Pycelle and Ser Barristan followed close behind A double column of men-at-arms in chainmail and steel helms was waiting outside the tower eight strong Grey cloaks snapped in the wind as the guardsmen marched them across the yard There was no Lannister crimson to be seen but Ned was reassured by the number of gold cloaks visible on the ramparts and at the gates

Janos Slynt met them at the door to the throne room armored in ornate black-and-gold plate with a high-crested helm under one arm The Commander bowed stiffly His men pushed open the great oaken doors twenty feet tall and banded with bronze

The royal steward led them in All hail His Grace Joffrey of the Houses Baratheon and Lannister the First of his Name King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm he sang out

It was a long walk to the far end of the hall where Joffrey waited atop the Iron Throne Supported by Littlefinger Ned Stark slowly limped and hopped toward the boy who called himself king The others followed The first time he had come this way he had been on horseback sword in hand and the Targaryen dragons had watched from the walls as he forced Jaime Lannister down from the throne He wondered if Joffrey would step down quite so easily

Five knights of the Kingsguard—all but Ser Jaime and Ser Barristan—were arrayed in a crescent around the base of the throne They were in full armor enameled steel from helm to heel long pale cloaks over their shoulders shining white shields strapped to their left arms Cersei Lannister and her two younger children stood behind Ser Boros and Ser Meryn The queen wore a gown of sea-green silk trimmed with Myrish lace as pale as foam On her finger was a golden ring with an emerald the size of a pigeon’s egg on her head a matching tiara

Above them Prince Joffrey sat amidst the barbs and spikes in a cloth-of-gold doublet and a red satin cape Sandor Clegane was stationed at the foot of the throne’s steep narrow stair He wore mail and soot-grey plate and his snarling dog’s-head helm

Behind the throne twenty Lannister guardsmen waited with longswords hanging from their belts Crimson cloaks draped their shoulders and steel lions crested their helms But Littlefinger had kept his promise all along the walls in front of Robert’s tapestries with their scenes of hunt and battle the gold-cloaked ranks of the City Watch stood stiffly to attention each man’s hand clasped around the haft of an eight-foot-long spear tipped in black iron They outnumbered the Lannisters five to one

Ned’s leg was a blaze of pain by the time he stopped He kept a hand on Littlefinger’s shoulder to help support his weight

Joffrey stood His red satin cape was patterned in gold thread fifty roaring lions to one side fifty prancing stags to the other I command the council to make all the necessary arrangements for my coronation the boy proclaimed I wish to be crowned within the fortnight Today I shall accept oaths of fealty from my loyal councillors

Ned produced Robert’s letter Lord Varys be so kind as to show this to my lady of Lannister

The eunuch carried the letter to Cersei The queen glanced at the words Protector of the Realm she read Is this meant to be your shield my lord A piece of paper She ripped the letter in half ripped the halves in quarters and let the pieces flutter to the floor

Those were the king’s words Ser Barristan said shocked

We have a new king now Cersei Lannister replied Lord Eddard when last we spoke you gave me some counsel Allow me to return the courtesy Bend the knee my lord Bend the knee and swear fealty to my son and we shall allow you to step down as Hand and live out your days in the grey waste you call home

Would that I could Ned said grimly If she was so determined to force the issue here and now she left him no choice Your son has no claim to the throne he sits Lord Stannis is Robert’s true heir

Liar Joffrey screamed his face reddening

Mother what does he mean Princess Myrcella asked the queen plaintively Isn’t Joff the king now

You condemn yourself with your own mouth Lord Stark said Cersei Lannister Ser Barristan seize this traitor
