The sun was well above the mountains by the time Catelyn Stark finally reached the Eyrie A stocky silver-haired man in a sky-blue cloak and hammered moon-and-falcon breastplate helped her from the basket Ser Vardis Egen captain of Jon Arryn’s household guard Beside him stood Maester Colemon thin and nervous with too little hair and too much neck Lady Stark Ser Vardis said the pleasure is as great as it is unanticipated Maester Colemon bobbed his head in agreement Indeed it is my lady indeed it is I have sent word to your sister She left orders to be awakened the instant you arrived

I hope she had a good night’s rest Catelyn said with a certain bite in her tone that seemed to go unnoticed

The men escorted her from the winch room up a spiral stair The Eyrie was a small castle by the standards of the great houses seven slender white towers bunched as tightly as arrows in a quiver on a shoulder of the great mountain It had no need of stables nor smithys nor kennels but Ned said its granary was as large as Winterfell’s and its towers could house five hundred men Yet it seemed strangely deserted to Catelyn as she passed through it its pale stone halls echoing and empty

Lysa was waiting alone in her solar still clad in her bed robes Her long auburn hair tumbled unbound across bare white shoulders and down her back A maid stood behind her brushing out the night’s tangles but when Catelyn entered her sister rose to her feet smiling Cat she said Oh Cat how good it is to see you My sweet sister She ran across the chamber and wrapped her sister in her arms How long it has been Lysa murmured against her Oh how very very long

It had been five years in truth five cruel years for Lysa They had taken their toll Her sister was two years the younger yet she looked older now Shorter than Catelyn Lysa had grown thick of body pale and puffy of face She had the blue eyes of the Tullys but hers were pale and watery never still Her small mouth had turned petulant As Catelyn held her she remembered the slender high-breasted girl who’d waited beside her that day in the sept at Riverrun How lovely and full of hope she had been All that remained of her sister’s beauty was the great fall of thick auburn hair that cascaded to her waist

You look well Catelyn lied but… tired

Her sister broke the embrace Tired Yes Oh yes She seemed to notice the others then her maid Maester Colemon Ser Vardis Leave us she told them I wish to speak to my sister alone She held Catelyn’s hand as they withdrew…

… and dropped it the instant the door closed Catelyn saw her face change It was as if the sun had gone behind a cloud Have you taken leave of your senses Lysa snapped at her To bring him here without a word of permission without so much as a warning to drag us into your quarrels with the Lannisters…

My quarrels Catelyn could scarce believe what she was hearing A great fire burned in the hearth but there was no trace of warmth in Lysa’s voice They were your quarrels first sister It was you who sent me that cursed letter you who wrote that the Lannisters had murdered your husband

To warn you so you could stay away from them I never meant to fight them Gods Cat do you know what you’ve done

Mother a small voice said Lysa whirled her heavy robe swirling around her Robert Arryn Lord of the Eyrie stood in the doorway clutching a ragged cloth doll and looking at them with large eyes He was a painfully thin child small for his age and sickly all his days and from time to time he trembled The shaking sickness the maesters called it I heard voices

Small wonder Catelyn thought Lysa had almost been shouting Still her sister looked daggers at her This is your aunt Catelyn baby My sister Lady Stark Do you remember

The boy glanced at her blankly I think so he said blinking though he had been less than a year old the last time Catelyn had seen him

Lysa seated herself near the fire and said Come to Mother my sweet one She straightened his bedclothes and fussed with his fine brown hair Isn’t he beautiful And strong too don’t you believe the things you hear Jon knew The seed is strong he told me His last words He kept saying Robert’s name and he grabbed my arm so hard he left marks Tell them the seed is strong His seed He wanted everyone to know what a good strong boy my baby was going to be

Lysa Catelyn said if you’re right about the Lannisters all the more reason we must act quickly We—

Not in front of the baby Lysa said He has a delicate temper don’t you sweet one

The boy is Lord of the Eyrie and Defender of the Vale Catelyn reminded her and these are no times for delicacy Ned thinks it may come to war

Quiet Lysa snapped at her You’re scaring the boy Little Robert took a quick peek over his shoulder at Catelyn and began to tremble His doll fell to the rushes and he pressed himself against his mother Don’t be afraid my sweet baby Lysa whispered Mother’s here nothing will hurt you She opened her robe and drew out a pale heavy breast tipped with red The boy grabbed for it eagerly buried his face against her chest and began to suck Lysa stroked his hair

Catelyn was at a loss for words Jon Arryn’s son she thought incredulously She remembered her own baby three-year-old Rickon half the age of this boy and five times as fierce Small wonder the lords of the Vale were restive For the first time she understood why the king had tried to take the child away from his mother to foster with the Lannisters…

We’re safe here Lysa was saying Whether to her or to the boy Catelyn was not sure

Don’t be a fool Catelyn said the anger rising in her No one is safe If you think hiding here will make the Lannisters forget you you are sadly mistaken

Lysa covered her boy’s ear with her hand Even if they could bring an army through the mountains and past the Bloody Gate the Eyrie is impregnable You saw for yourself No enemy could ever reach us up here

Catelyn wanted to slap her Uncle Brynden had tried to warn her she realized No castle is impregnable

This one is Lysa insisted Everyone says so The only thing is what am I to do with this Imp you have brought me

Is he a bad man the Lord of the Eyrie asked his mother’s breast popping from his mouth the nipple wet and red

A very bad man Lysa told him as she covered herself but Mother won’t let him harm my little baby

Make him fly Robert said eagerly

Lysa stroked her son’s hair Perhaps we will she murmured Perhaps that is just what we will do





EDDARD

He found Littlefinger in the brothel’s common room chatting amiably with a tall elegant woman who wore a feathered gown over skin as black as ink By the hearth Heward and a buxom wench were playing at forfeits From the look of it he’d lost his belt his cloak his mail shirt and his right boot so far while the girl had been forced to unbutton her shift to the waist Jory Cassel stood beside a rain-streaked window with a wry smile on his face watching Heward turn over tiles and enjoying the view

Ned paused at the foot of the stair and pulled on his gloves It’s time we took our leave My business here is done

Heward lurched to his feet hurriedly gathering up his things As you will my lord Jory said I’ll help Wyl bring round the horses He strode to the door

Littlefinger took his time saying his farewells He kissed the black woman’s hand whispered some joke that made her laugh aloud and sauntered over to Ned Your business he said lightly or Robert’s They say the Hand dreams the king’s dreams speaks with the king’s voice and rules with the king’s sword Does that also mean you fuck with the king’s—

Lord Baelish Ned interrupted you presume too much I am not ungrateful for your help It might have taken us years to find this brothel without you That does not mean I intend to endure your mockery And I am no longer the King’s Hand

The direwolf must be a prickly beast said Littlefinger with a sharp twist of his mouth

A warm rain was pelting down from a starless black sky as they walked to the stables Ned drew up the hood of his cloak Jory brought out his horse Young Wyl came right behind him leading Littlefinger’s mare with one hand while the other fumbled with his belt and the lacings of his trousers A barefoot whore leaned out of the stable door giggling at him

Will we be going back to the castle now my lord Jory asked Ned nodded and swung into the saddle Littlefinger mounted up beside him Jory and the others followed

Chataya runs a choice establishment Littlefinger said as they rode I’ve half a mind to buy it Brothels are a much sounder investment than ships I’ve found Whores seldom sink and when they are boarded by pirates why the pirates pay good coin like everyone else Lord Petyr chuckled at his own wit

Ned let him prattle on After a time he quieted and they rode in silence The streets of King’s Landing were dark and deserted The rain had driven everyone under their roofs It beat down on Ned’s head warm as blood and relentless as old guilts Fat drops of water ran down his face

Robert will never keep to one bed Lyanna had told him at Winterfell on the night long ago when their father had promised her hand to the young Lord of Storm’s End I hear he has gotten a child on some girl in the Vale Ned had held the babe in his arms he could scarcely deny her nor would he lie to his sister but he had assured her that what Robert did before their betrothal was of no matter that he was a good man and true who would love her with all his heart Lyanna had only smiled Love is sweet dearest Ned but it cannot change a man’s nature

The girl had been so young Ned had not dared to ask her age No doubt she’d been a virgin the better brothels could always find a virgin if the purse was fat enough She had light red hair and a powdering of freckles across the bridge of her nose and when she slipped free a breast to give her nipple to the babe he saw that her bosom was freckled as well I named her Barra she said as the child nursed She looks so like him does she not milord She has his nose and his hair…

She does Eddard Stark had touched the baby’s fine dark hair It flowed through his fingers like black silk Robert’s firstborn had had the same fine hair he seemed to recall

Tell him that when you see him milord as it… as it please you Tell him how beautiful she is

I will Ned had promised her That was his curse Robert would swear undying love and forget them before evenfall but Ned Stark kept his vows He thought of the promises he’d made Lyanna as she lay dying and the price he’d paid to keep them

And tell him I’ve not been with no one else I swear it milord by the old gods and new Chataya said I could have half a year for the baby and for hoping he’d come back So you’ll tell him I’m waiting won’t you I don’t want no jewels or nothing just him He was always good to me truly

Good to you Ned thought hollowly I will tell him child and I promise you Barra shall not go wanting

She had smiled then a smile so tremulous and sweet that it cut the heart out of him Riding through the rainy night Ned saw Jon Snow’s face in front of him so like a younger version of his own If the gods frowned so on bastards he thought dully why did they fill men with such lusts Lord Baelish what do you know of Robert’s bastards

Well he has more than you for a start
