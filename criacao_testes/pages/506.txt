946 They slay the widow and the stranger and murder the fatherless

947 Yet they say The LORD shall not see neither shall the God of
Jacob regard it

948 Understand ye brutish among the people and ye fools when will
ye be wise

949 He that planted the ear shall he not hear he that formed the
eye shall he not see

9410 He that chastiseth the heathen shall not he correct he that
teacheth man knowledge shall not he know

9411 The LORD knoweth the thoughts of man that they are vanity

9412 Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest O LORD and teachest
him out of thy law

9413 That thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity until
the pit be digged for the wicked

9414 For the LORD will not cast off his people neither will he
forsake his inheritance

9415 But judgment shall return unto righteousness and all the
upright in heart shall follow it

9416 Who will rise up for me against the evildoers or who will stand
up for me against the workers of iniquity

9417 Unless the LORD had been my help my soul had almost dwelt in
silence

9418 When I said My foot slippeth thy mercy O LORD held me up

9419 In the multitude of my thoughts within me thy comforts delight
my soul

9420 Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee which
frameth mischief by a law

9421 They gather themselves together against the soul of the
righteous and condemn the innocent blood

9422 But the LORD is my defence and my God is the rock of my refuge

9423 And he shall bring upon them their own iniquity and shall cut
them off in their own wickedness yea the LORD our God shall cut them
off



951 O come let us sing unto the LORD let us make a joyful noise to
the rock of our salvation

952 Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving and make a
joyful noise unto him with psalms

953 For the LORD is a great God and a great King above all gods

954 In his hand are the deep places of the earth the strength of the
hills is his also

955 The sea is his and he made it and his hands formed the dry
land

956 O come let us worship and bow down let us kneel before the LORD
our maker

957 For he is our God and we are the people of his pasture and the
sheep of his hand To day if ye will hear his voice

958 Harden not your heart as in the provocation and as in the day
of temptation in the wilderness

959 When your fathers tempted me proved me and saw my work

9510 Forty years long was I grieved with this generation and said
It is a people that do err in their heart and they have not known my
ways

9511 Unto whom I sware in my wrath that they should not enter into my
rest



961 O sing unto the LORD a new song sing unto the LORD all the
earth

962 Sing unto the LORD bless his name shew forth his salvation from
day to day

963 Declare his glory among the heathen his wonders among all
people

964 For the LORD is great and greatly to be praised he is to be
feared above all gods

965 For all the gods of the nations are idols but the LORD made the
