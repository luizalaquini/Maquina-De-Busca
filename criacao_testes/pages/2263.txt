He was speechless for an instant Even Sansa did not know not then How could you know Did Varys tell you

Some page was telling Ser Tallad about it when I took Lollys to the sept He had it from this serving girl who heard Ser Kevan talking to your father She wriggled free of his grasp and pulled her dress up over her head As ever she was naked underneath I don’t care She’s only a little girl You’ll give her a big belly and come back to me

Some part of him had hoped for less indifference Had hoped he jeered bitterly but now you know better dwarf Shae is all the love you’re ever like to have

Muddy Way was crowded but soldiers and townfolk alike made way for the Imp and his escort Hollow-eyed children swarmed underfoot some looking up in silent appeal whilst others begged noisily Tyrion pulled a big fistful of coppers from his purse and tossed them in the air and the children went running for them shoving and shouting The lucky ones might be able to buy a heel of stale bread tonight He had never seen markets so crowded and for all the food the Tyrells were bringing in prices remained shockingly high Six coppers for a melon a silver stag for a bushel of corn a dragon for a side of beef or six skinny piglets Yet there seemed no lack of buyers Gaunt men and haggard women crowded around every wagon and stall while others even more ragged looked on sullenly from the mouths of alleys

This way Bronn said when they reached the foot of the Hook If you still mean to    

I do The riverfront had made a convenient excuse but Tyrion had another purpose today It was not a task he relished but it must be done They turned away from Aegon’s High Hill into the maze of smaller streets that clustered around the foot of Visenya’s Bronn led the way Once or twice Tyrion glanced back over his shoulder to see if they were being followed but there was nothing to be seen except the usual rabble a carter beating his horse an old woman throwing nightsoil from her window two little boys fighting with sticks three gold cloaks escorting a captive    they all looked innocent but any one of them could be his undoing Varys had informers everywhere

They turned at a corner and again at the next and rode slowly through a crowd of women at a well Bronn led him along a curving wynd through an alley under a broken archway They cut through the rubble where a house had burned and walked their horses up a shallow flight of stone steps The buildings were close and poor Bronn halted at the mouth of a crooked alley too narrow for two to ride abreast There’s two jags and then a dead end The sink is in the cellar of the last building

Tyrion swung down off his horse See that no one enters or leaves till I return This won’t take long His hand went into his cloak to make certain the gold was still there in the hidden pocket Thirty dragons A bloody fortune for a man like him He waddled up the alley quickly anxious to be done with this

The wine sink was a dismal place dark and damp walls pale with niter the ceiling so low that Bronn would have had to duck to keep from hitting his head on the beams Tyrion Lannister had no such problem At this hour the front room was empty but for a dead-eyed woman who sat on a stool behind a rough plank bar She handed him a cup of sour wine and said In the back

The back room was even darker A flickering candle burned on a low table beside a flagon of wine The man behind it scarce looked a danger a short man—though all men were tall to Tyrion—with thinning brown hair pink cheeks and a little pot pushing at the bone buttons of his doeskin jerkin In his soft hands he held a twelve-stringed woodharp more deadly than a longsword

Tyrion sat across from him Symon Silver Tongue

The man inclined his head He was bald on top My lord Hand he said

You mistake me My father is the King’s Hand I am no longer even a finger I fear

You shall rise again I am sure A man like you My sweet lady Shae tells me you are newly wed Would that you had sent for me earlier I should have been honored to sing at your feast

The last thing my wife needs is more songs said Tyrion As for Shae we both know she is no lady and I would thank you never to speak her name aloud

As the Hand commands Symon said

The last time Tyrion had seen the man a sharp word had been enough to set him sweating but it seemed the singer had found some courage somewhere Most like in that flagon Or perhaps Tyrion himself was to blame for this new boldness I threatened him but nothing ever came of the threat so now he believes me toothless He sighed I am told you are a very gifted singer

You are most kind to say so my lord

Tyrion gave him a smile I think it is time you brought your music to the Free Cities They are great lovers of song in Braavos and Pentos and Lys and generous with those who please them He took a sip of wine It was foul stuff but strong A tour of all nine cities would be best You wouldn’t want to deny anyone the joy of hearing you sing A year in each should suffice He reached inside his cloak to where the gold was hidden With the port closed you will need to go to Duskendale to take ship but my man Bronn will find a horse for you and I would be honored if you would let me pay your passage   

But my lord the man objected you have never heard me sing Pray listen a moment His fingers moved deftly over the strings of the woodharp and soft music filled the cellar Symon began to sing

He rode through the streets of the city

down from his hill on high

O’er the wynds and the steps and the cobbles

he rode to a woman’s sigh

For she was his secret treasure

she was his shame and his bliss

And a chain and a keep are nothing

compared to a woman’s kiss

There’s more the man said as he broke off Oh a good deal more The refrain is especially nice I think For hands of gold are always cold but a woman’s hands are warm   

Enough Tyrion slid his fingers from his cloak empty That’s not a song I would care to hear again Ever

No Symon Silver Tongue put his harp aside and took a sip of wine A pity Still each man has his song as my old master used to say when he was teaching me to play Others might like my tune better The queen perhaps Or your lord father

Tyrion rubbed the scar over his nose and said My father has no time for singers and my sister is not as generous as one might think A wise man could earn more from silence than from song He could not put it much plainer than that

Symon seemed to take his meaning quick enough You will find my price modest my lord

That’s good to know This would not be a matter of thirty golden dragons Tyrion feared Tell me

At King Joffrey’s wedding feast the man said there is to be a tournament of singers

And jugglers and jesters and dancing bears

Only one dancing bear my lord said Symon who had plainly attended Cersei’s arrangements with far more interest than Tyrion had but seven singers Galyeon of Cuy Bethany Fair-fingers Aemon Costayne Alaric of Eysen Hamish the Harper Collio Quaynis and Orland of Oldtown will compete for a gilded lute with silver strings    yet unaccountably no invitation has been forthcoming for one who is master of them all

Let me guess Symon Silver Tongue

Symon smiled modestly I am prepared to prove the truth of my boast before king and court Hamish is old and oft forgets what he is singing And Collio with that absurd Tyroshi accent If you understand one word in three count yourself fortunate

My sweet sister has arranged the feast Even if I could secure you this invitation it might look queer Seven kingdoms seven vows seven challenges seventy-seven dishes    but eight singers What would the High Septon think

You did not strike me as a pious man my lord

Piety is not the point Certain forms must be observed

Symon took a sip of wine Still    a singer’s life is not without peril We ply our trade in alehouses and wine sinks before unruly drunkards If one of your sister’s seven should suffer some mishap I hope you might consider me to fill his place He smiled slyly inordinately pleased with himself

Six singers would be as unfortunate as eight to be sure I will inquire after the health of Cersei’s seven If any of them should be indisposed my man Bronn will find you

Very good my lord Symon might have left it at that but flushed with triumph he added I shall sing the night of King Joffrey’s wedding Should it happen that I am called to court why I will want to offer the king my very best compositions songs I have sung a thousand times that are certain to please If I should find myself singing in some dreary winesink though    well that would be an apt occasion to try my new song For hands of gold are always cold but a woman’s hands are warm

That will not be necessary said Tyrion You have my word as a Lannister Bronn will call upon you soon

Very good my lord The balding kettle-bellied singer took up his woodharp again

Bronn was waiting with the horses at the mouth of the alley He helped Tyrion into his saddle When do I take the man to Duskendale

You don’t Tyrion turned his horse Give him three days then inform him that Hamish the Harper has broken his arm Tell him that his clothes will never serve for court so he must be fitted for new garb at once He’ll come with you quick enough He grimaced You may want his tongue I understand it’s made of silver The rest of him should never be found

Bronn grinned There’s a pot shop I know in Flea Bottom makes a savory bowl of brown All kinds of meat in it I hear
