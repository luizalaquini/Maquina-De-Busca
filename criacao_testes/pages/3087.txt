2125 And thou profane wicked prince of Israel whose day is come
when iniquity shall have an end 2126 Thus saith the Lord GOD Remove
the diadem and take off the crown this shall not be the same exalt
him that is low and abase him that is high

2127 I will overturn overturn overturn it and it shall be no
more until he come whose right it is and I will give it him

2128 And thou son of man prophesy and say Thus saith the Lord GOD
concerning the Ammonites and concerning their reproach even say
thou The sword the sword is drawn for the slaughter it is
furbished to consume because of the glittering 2129 Whiles they see
vanity unto thee whiles they divine a lie unto thee to bring thee
upon the necks of them that are slain of the wicked whose day is
come when their iniquity shall have an end

2130 Shall I cause it to return into his sheath I will judge thee in
the place where thou wast created in the land of thy nativity

2131 And I will pour out mine indignation upon thee I will blow
against thee in the fire of my wrath and deliver thee into the hand
of brutish men and skilful to destroy

2132 Thou shalt be for fuel to the fire thy blood shall be in the
midst of the land thou shalt be no more remembered for I the LORD
have spoken it

221 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me saying 222 Now
thou son of man wilt thou judge wilt thou judge the bloody city
yea thou shalt shew her all her abominations

223 Then say thou Thus saith the Lord GOD The city sheddeth blood
in the midst of it that her time may come and maketh idols against
herself to defile herself

224 Thou art become guilty in thy blood that thou hast shed and hast
defiled thyself in thine idols which thou hast made and thou hast
caused thy days to draw near and art come even unto thy years
therefore have I made thee a reproach unto the heathen and a mocking
to all countries

225 Those that be near and those that be far from thee shall mock
thee which art infamous and much vexed

226 Behold the princes of Israel every one were in thee to their
power to shed blood

227 In thee have they set light by father and mother in the midst of
thee have they dealt by oppression with the stranger in thee have
they vexed the fatherless and the widow

228 Thou hast despised mine holy things and hast profaned my
sabbaths

229 In thee are men that carry tales to shed blood and in thee they
eat upon the mountains in the midst of thee they commit lewdness

2210 In thee have they discovered their fathers nakedness in thee
have they humbled her that was set apart for pollution

2211 And one hath committed abomination with his neighbours wife
and another hath lewdly defiled his daughter in law and another in
thee hath humbled his sister his fathers daughter

2212 In thee have they taken gifts to shed blood thou hast taken
usury and increase and thou hast greedily gained of thy neighbours by
extortion and hast forgotten me saith the Lord GOD

2213 Behold therefore I have smitten mine hand at thy dishonest gain
which thou hast made and at thy blood which hath been in the midst of
thee

2214 Can thine heart endure or can thine hands be strong in the
days that I shall deal with thee I the LORD have spoken it and will
do it

2215 And I will scatter thee among the heathen and disperse thee in
the countries and will consume thy filthiness out of thee

2216 And thou shalt take thine inheritance in thyself in the sight of
the heathen and thou shalt know that I am the LORD

2217 And the word of the LORD came unto me saying 2218 Son of man
the house of Israel is to me become dross all they are brass and
tin and iron and lead in the midst of the furnace they are even
the dross of silver

2219 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD Because ye are all become
dross behold therefore I will gather you into the midst of
Jerusalem

2220 As they gather silver and brass and iron and lead and tin
into the midst of the furnace to blow the fire upon it to melt it
so will I gather you in mine anger and in my fury and I will leave
you there and melt you

2221 Yea I will gather you and blow upon you in the fire of my
wrath and ye shall be melted in the midst therof
