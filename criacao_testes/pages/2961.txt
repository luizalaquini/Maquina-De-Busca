218 Yea I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun
because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me

219 And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a fool yet
shall he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured and
wherein I have shewed myself wise under the sun This is also vanity

220 Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the
labour which I took under the sun

221 For there is a man whose labour is in wisdom and in knowledge
and in equity yet to a man that hath not laboured therein shall he
leave it for his portion This also is vanity and a great evil

222 For what hath man of all his labour and of the vexation of his
heart wherein he hath laboured under the sun  223 For all his days
are sorrows and his travail grief yea his heart taketh not rest in
the night This is also vanity

224 There is nothing better for a man than that he should eat and
drink and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour This
also I saw that it was from the hand of God

225 For who can eat or who else can hasten hereunto more than I
226 For God giveth to a man that is good in his sight wisdom and
knowledge and joy but to the sinner he giveth travail to gather and
to heap up that he may give to him that is good before God This also
is vanity and vexation of spirit

31 To every thing there is a season and a time to every purpose
under the heaven 32 A time to be born and a time to die a time to
plant and a time to pluck up that which is planted 33 A time to
kill and a time to heal a time to break down and a time to build
up 34 A time to weep and a time to laugh a time to mourn and a
time to dance 35 A time to cast away stones and a time to gather
stones together a time to embrace and a time to refrain from
embracing 36 A time to get and a time to lose a time to keep and
a time to cast away 37 A time to rend and a time to sew a time to
keep silence and a time to speak 38 A time to love and a time to
hate a time of war and a time of peace

39 What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboureth
310 I have seen the travail which God hath given to the sons of men
to be exercised in it

311 He hath made every thing beautiful in his time also he hath set
the world in their heart so that no man can find out the work that
God maketh from the beginning to the end

312 I know that there is no good in them but for a man to rejoice
and to do good in his life

313 And also that every man should eat and drink and enjoy the good
of all his labour it is the gift of God

314 I know that whatsoever God doeth it shall be for ever nothing
can be put to it nor any thing taken from it and God doeth it that
men should fear before him

315 That which hath been is now and that which is to be hath already
been and God requireth that which is past

316 And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment that
wickedness was there and the place of righteousness that iniquity
was there

317 I said in mine heart God shall judge the righteous and the
wicked for there is a time there for every purpose and for every
work

318 I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men
that God might manifest them and that they might see that they
themselves are beasts

319 For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts even
one thing befalleth them as the one dieth so dieth the other yea
they have all one breath so that a man hath no preeminence above a
beast for all is vanity

320 All go unto one place all are of the dust and all turn to dust
again

321 Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward and the spirit
of the beast that goeth downward to the earth  322 Wherefore I
perceive that there is nothing better than that a man should rejoice
in his own works for that is his portion for who shall bring him to
see what shall be after him  41 So I returned and considered all
the oppressions that are done under the sun and behold the tears of
such as were oppressed and they had no comforter and on the side of
their oppressors there was power but they had no comforter

42 Wherefore I praised the dead which are already dead more than the
living which are yet alive

43 Yea better is he than both they which hath not yet been who
hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun

44 Again I considered all travail and every right work that for
this a man is envied of his neighbour This is also vanity and
vexation of spirit
