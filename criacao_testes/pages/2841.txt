1410 But man dieth and wasteth away yea man giveth up the ghost
and where is he  1411 As the waters fail from the sea and the flood
decayeth and drieth up 1412 So man lieth down and riseth not till
the heavens be no more they shall not awake nor be raised out of
their sleep

1413 O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave that thou wouldest
keep me secret until thy wrath be past that thou wouldest appoint me
a set time and remember me  1414 If a man die shall he live again
all the days of my appointed time will I wait till my change come

1415 Thou shalt call and I will answer thee thou wilt have a desire
to the work of thine hands

1416 For now thou numberest my steps dost thou not watch over my
sin  1417 My transgression is sealed up in a bag and thou sewest up
mine iniquity

1418 And surely the mountains falling cometh to nought and the rock
is removed out of his place

1419 The waters wear the stones thou washest away the things which
grow out of the dust of the earth and thou destroyest the hope of
man

1420 Thou prevailest for ever against him and he passeth thou
changest his countenance and sendest him away

1421 His sons come to honour and he knoweth it not and they are
brought low but he perceiveth it not of them

1422 But his flesh upon him shall have pain and his soul within him
shall mourn

151 Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite and said 152 Should a wise
man utter vain knowledge and fill his belly with the east wind  153
Should he reason with unprofitable talk or with speeches wherewith he
can do no good  154 Yea thou castest off fear and restrainest
prayer before God

155 For thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity and thou choosest the
tongue of the crafty

156 Thine own mouth condemneth thee and not I yea thine own lips
testify against thee

157 Art thou the first man that was born or wast thou made before
the hills  158 Hast thou heard the secret of God and dost thou
restrain wisdom to thyself  159 What knowest thou that we know not
what understandest thou which is not in us  1510 With us are both
the grayheaded and very aged men much elder than thy father

1511 Are the consolations of God small with thee is there any secret
thing with thee  1512 Why doth thine heart carry thee away and what
do thy eyes wink at 1513 That thou turnest thy spirit against God
and lettest such words go out of thy mouth  1514 What is man that
he should be clean and he which is born of a woman that he should be
righteous  1515 Behold he putteth no trust in his saints yea the
heavens are not clean in his sight

1516 How much more abominable and filthy is man which drinketh
iniquity like water  1517 I will shew thee hear me and that which
I have seen I will declare 1518 Which wise men have told from their
fathers and have not hid it 1519 Unto whom alone the earth was
given and no stranger passed among them

1520 The wicked man travaileth with pain all his days and the number
of years is hidden to the oppressor

1521 A dreadful sound is in his ears in prosperity the destroyer
shall come upon him

1522 He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness and he is
waited for of the sword

1523 He wandereth abroad for bread saying Where is it he knoweth
that the day of darkness is ready at his hand

1524 Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid they shall prevail
against him as a king ready to the battle

1525 For he stretcheth out his hand against God and strengtheneth
himself against the Almighty

1526 He runneth upon him even on his neck upon the thick bosses of
his bucklers 1527 Because he covereth his face with his fatness and
maketh collops of fat on his flanks

1528 And he dwelleth in desolate cities and in houses which no man
inhabiteth which are ready to become heaps

1529 He shall not be rich neither shall his substance continue
neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof upon the earth

1530 He shall not depart out of darkness the flame shall dry up his
branches and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away

1531 Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity for vanity shall
be his recompence
