water and I will sweep it with the besom of destruction saith the
LORD of hosts

1424 The LORD of hosts hath sworn saying Surely as I have thought
so shall it come to pass and as I have purposed so shall it stand
1425 That I will break the Assyrian in my land and upon my mountains
tread him under foot then shall his yoke depart from off them and
his burden depart from off their shoulders

1426 This is the purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth and
this is the hand that is stretched out upon all the nations

1427 For the LORD of hosts hath purposed and who shall disannul it
and his hand is stretched out and who shall turn it back  1428 In
the year that king Ahaz died was this burden

1429 Rejoice not thou whole Palestina because the rod of him that
smote thee is broken for out of the serpents root shall come forth a
cockatrice and his fruit shall be a fiery flying serpent

1430 And the firstborn of the poor shall feed and the needy shall
lie down in safety and I will kill thy root with famine and he shall
slay thy remnant

1431 Howl O gate cry O city thou whole Palestina art dissolved
for there shall come from the north a smoke and none shall be alone
in his appointed times

1432 What shall one then answer the messengers of the nation That
the LORD hath founded Zion and the poor of his people shall trust in
it

151 The burden of Moab Because in the night Ar of Moab is laid
waste and brought to silence because in the night Kir of Moab is
laid waste and brought to silence 152 He is gone up to Bajith and
to Dibon the high places to weep Moab shall howl over Nebo and
over Medeba on all their heads shall be baldness and every beard cut
off

153 In their streets they shall gird themselves with sackcloth on
the tops of their houses and in their streets every one shall howl
weeping abundantly

154 And Heshbon shall cry and Elealeh their voice shall be heard
even unto Jahaz therefore the armed soldiers of Moab shall cry out
his life shall be grievous unto him

155 My heart shall cry out for Moab his fugitives shall flee unto
Zoar an heifer of three years old for by the mounting up of Luhith
with weeping shall they go it up for in the way of Horonaim they
shall raise up a cry of destruction

156 For the waters of Nimrim shall be desolate for the hay is
withered away the grass faileth there is no green thing

157 Therefore the abundance they have gotten and that which they
have laid up shall they carry away to the brook of the willows

158 For the cry is gone round about the borders of Moab the howling
thereof unto Eglaim and the howling thereof unto Beerelim

159 For the waters of Dimon shall be full of blood for I will bring
more upon Dimon lions upon him that escapeth of Moab and upon the
remnant of the land

161 Send ye the lamb to the ruler of the land from Sela to the
wilderness unto the mount of the daughter of Zion

162 For it shall be that as a wandering bird cast out of the nest
so the daughters of Moab shall be at the fords of Arnon

163 Take counsel execute judgment make thy shadow as the night in
the midst of the noonday hide the outcasts bewray not him that
wandereth

164 Let mine outcasts dwell with thee Moab be thou a covert to them
from the face of the spoiler for the extortioner is at an end the
spoiler ceaseth the oppressors are consumed out of the land

165 And in mercy shall the throne be established and he shall sit
upon it in truth in the tabernacle of David judging and seeking
judgment and hasting righteousness

166 We have heard of the pride of Moab he is very proud even of his
haughtiness and his pride and his wrath but his lies shall not be
so

167 Therefore shall Moab howl for Moab every one shall howl for the
foundations of Kirhareseth shall ye mourn surely they are stricken

168 For the fields of Heshbon languish and the vine of Sibmah the
lords of the heathen have broken down the principal plants thereof
they are come even unto Jazer they wandered through the wilderness
her branches are stretched out they are gone over the sea

169 Therefore I will bewail with the weeping of Jazer the vine of
Sibmah I will water thee with my tears O Heshbon and Elealeh for
the shouting for thy summer fruits and for thy harvest is fallen

1610 And gladness is taken away and joy out of the plentiful field
