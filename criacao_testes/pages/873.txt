1942 There laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jews preparation
day for the sepulchre was nigh at hand

201 The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early when it
was yet dark unto the sepulchre and seeth the stone taken away from
the sepulchre

202 Then she runneth and cometh to Simon Peter and to the other
disciple whom Jesus loved and saith unto them They have taken away
the LORD out of the sepulchre and we know not where they have laid
him

203 Peter therefore went forth and that other disciple and came to
the sepulchre

204 So they ran both together and the other disciple did outrun
Peter and came first to the sepulchre

205 And he stooping down and looking in saw the linen clothes
lying yet went he not in

206 Then cometh Simon Peter following him and went into the
sepulchre and seeth the linen clothes lie 207 And the napkin that
was about his head not lying with the linen clothes but wrapped
together in a place by itself

208 Then went in also that other disciple which came first to the
sepulchre and he saw and believed

209 For as yet they knew not the scripture that he must rise again
from the dead

2010 Then the disciples went away again unto their own home

2011 But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping and as she
wept she stooped down and looked into the sepulchre 2012 And seeth
two angels in white sitting the one at the head and the other at the
feet where the body of Jesus had lain

2013 And they say unto her Woman why weepest thou She saith unto
them Because they have taken away my LORD and I know not where they
have laid him

2014 And when she had thus said she turned herself back and saw
Jesus standing and knew not that it was Jesus

2015 Jesus saith unto her Woman why weepest thou whom seekest
thou  She supposing him to be the gardener saith unto him Sir if
thou have borne him hence tell me where thou hast laid him and I
will take him away

2016 Jesus saith unto her Mary She turned herself and saith unto
him Rabboni which is to say Master

2017 Jesus saith unto her Touch me not for I am not yet ascended to
my Father but go to my brethren and say unto them I ascend unto my
Father and your Father and to my God and your God

2018 Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the
LORD and that he had spoken these things unto her

2019 Then the same day at evening being the first day of the week
when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear
of the Jews came Jesus and stood in the midst and saith unto them
Peace be unto you

2020 And when he had so said he shewed unto them his hands and his
side

Then were the disciples glad when they saw the LORD

2021 Then said Jesus to them again Peace be unto you as my Father
hath sent me even so send I you

2022 And when he had said this he breathed on them and saith unto
them Receive ye the Holy Ghost 2023 Whose soever sins ye remit
they are remitted unto them and whose soever sins ye retain they are
retained

2024 But Thomas one of the twelve called Didymus was not with them
when Jesus came

2025 The other disciples therefore said unto him We have seen the
LORD

But he said unto them Except I shall see in his hands the print of
the nails and put my finger into the print of the nails and thrust
my hand into his side I will not believe

2026 And after eight days again his disciples were within and Thomas
with them then came Jesus the doors being shut and stood in the
midst and said Peace be unto you

2027 Then saith he to Thomas Reach hither thy finger and behold my
hands and reach hither thy hand and thrust it into my side and be
not faithless but believing

2028 And Thomas answered and said unto him My LORD and my God
