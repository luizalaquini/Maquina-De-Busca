Podrick Payne was waiting outside his chambers I laid out your new doublet Not here On your bed In the bedchamber

Yes that’s where we keep the bed Sansa would be in there dressing for the feast Shae as well Wine Pod

Tyrion drank it in his window seat brooding over the chaos of the kitchens below The sun had not yet touched the top of the castle wall but he could smell breads baking and meats roasting The guests would soon be pouring into the throne room full of anticipation this would be an evening of song and splendor designed not only to unite Highgarden and Casterly Rock but to trumpet their power and wealth as a lesson to any who might still think to oppose Joffrey’s rule

But who would be mad enough to contest Joffrey’s rule now after what had befallen Stannis Baratheon and Robb Stark There was still fighting in the riverlands but everywhere the coils were tightening Ser Gregor Clegane had crossed the Trident and seized the ruby ford then captured Harrenhal almost effortlessly Seagard had yielded to Black Walder Frey Lord Randyll Tarly held Maidenpool Duskendale and the kingsroad In the west Ser Daven Lannister had linked up with Ser Forley Prester at the Golden Tooth for a march on Riverrun Ser Ryman Frey was leading two thousand spears down from the Twins to join them And Paxter Redwyne claimed his fleet would soon set sail from the Arbor to begin the long voyage around Dorne and through the Stepstones Stannis’s Lyseni pirates would be outnumbered ten to one The struggle that the maesters were calling the War of the Five Kings was all but at an end Mace Tyrell had been heard complaining that Lord Tywin had left no victories for him

My lord Pod was at his side Will you be changing I laid out the doublet On your bed For the feast

Feast said Tyrion sourly What feast

The wedding feast Pod missed the sarcasm of course King Joffrey and Lady Margaery Queen Margaery I mean

Tyrion resolved to get very very drunk tonight Very well young Podrick let us go make me festive

Shae was helping Sansa with her hair when they entered the bedchamber Joy and grief he thought when he beheld them there together Laughter and tears Sansa wore a gown of silvery satin trimmed in vair with dagged sleeves that almost touched the floor lined in soft purple felt Shae had arranged her hair artfully in a delicate silver net winking with dark purple gemstones Tyrion had never seen her look more lovely yet she wore sorrow on those long satin sleeves Lady Sansa he told her you shall be the most beautiful woman in the hall tonight

My lord is too kind

My lady said Shae wistfully Couldn’t I come serve at table I so want to see the pigeons fly out of the pie

Sansa looked at her uncertainly The queen has chosen all the servers

And the hall will be too crowded Tyrion had to bite back his annoyance There will be musicians strolling all through the castle though and tables in the outer ward with food and drink for all He inspected his new doublet crimson velvet with padded shoulders and puffed sleeves slashed to show the black satin underlining A handsome garment All it wants is a handsome man to wear it Come Pod help me into this

He had another cup of wine as he dressed then took his wife by the arm and escorted her from the Kitchen Keep to join the river of silk satin and velvet flowing toward the throne room Some guests had gone inside to find their places on the benches Others were milling in front of the doors enjoying the unseasonable warmth of the afternoon Tyrion led Sansa around the yard to perform the necessary courtesies

She is good at this he thought as he watched her tell Lord Gyles that his cough was sounding better compliment Elinor Tyrell on her gown and question Jalabhar Xho about wedding customs in the Summer Isles His cousin Ser Lancel had been brought down by Ser Kevan the first time he’d left his sickbed since the battle He looks ghastly Lancel’s hair had turned white and brittle and he was thin as a stick Without his father beside him holding him up he would surely have collapsed Yet when Sansa praised his valor and said how good it was to see him getting strong again both Lancel and Ser Kevan beamed She would have made Joffrey a good queen and a better wife if he’d had the sense to love her He wondered if his nephew was capable of loving anyone

You do look quite exquisite child Lady Olenna Tyrell told Sansa when she tottered up to them in a cloth-of-gold gown that must have weighed more than she did The wind has been at your hair though The little old woman reached up and fussed at the loose strands tucking them back into place and straightening Sansa’s hair net I was very sorry to hear about your losses she said as she tugged and fiddled Your brother was a terrible traitor I know but if we start killing men at weddings they’ll be even more frightened of marriage than they are presently There that’s better Lady Olenna smiled I am pleased to say I shall be leaving for Highgarden the day after next I have had quite enough of this smelly city thank you Perhaps you would like to accompany me for a little visit whilst the men are off having their war I shall miss my Margaery so dreadfully and all her lovely ladies Your company would be such sweet solace

You are too kind my lady said Sansa but my place is with my lord husband

Lady Olenna gave Tyrion a wrinkled toothless smile Oh Forgive a silly old woman my lord I did not mean to steal your lovely wife I assumed you would be off leading a Lannister host against some wicked foe

A host of dragons and stags The master of coin must remain at court to see that all the armies are paid for

To be sure Dragons and stags that’s very clever And dwarf’s pennies as well I have heard of these dwarf’s pennies No doubt collecting those is such a dreadful chore

I leave the collecting to others my lady

Oh do you I would have thought you might want to tend to it yourself We can’t have the crown being cheated of its dwarf’s pennies now Can we

Gods forbid Tyrion was beginning to wonder whether Lord Luthor Tyrell had ridden off that cliff intentionally If you will excuse us Lady Olenna it is time we were in our places

Myself as well Seventy-seven courses I daresay Don’t you find that a bit excessive my lord I shan’t eat more than three or four bites myself but you and I are very little aren’t we She patted Sansa’s hair again and said Well off with you child and try to be merrier Now where have my guardsmen gone Left Right where are you Come help me to the dais

Although evenfall was still an hour away the throne room was already a blaze of light with torches burning in every sconce The guests stood along the tables as heralds called out the names and titles of the lords and ladies making their entrance Pages in the royal livery escorted them down the broad central aisle The gallery above was packed with musicians drummers and pipers and fiddlers strings and horns and skins

Tyrion clutched Sansa’s arm and made the walk with a heavy waddling stride He could feel their eyes on him picking at the fresh new scar that had left him even uglier than he had been before Let them look he thought as he hopped up onto his seat Let them stare and whisper until they’ve had their fill I will not hide myself for their sake The Queen of Thorns followed them in shuffling along with tiny little steps Tyrion wondered which of them looked more absurd him with Sansa or the wizened little woman between her seven-foot-tall twin guardsmen

Joffrey and Margaery rode into the throne room on matched white chargers Pages ran before them scattering rose petals under their hooves The king and queen had changed for the feast as well Joffrey wore striped black-and-crimson breeches and a cloth-of-gold doublet with black satin sleeves and onyx studs Margaery had exchanged the demure gown that she had worn in the sept for one much more revealing a confection in pale green samite with a tight-laced bodice that bared her shoulders and the tops of her small breasts Unbound her soft brown hair tumbled over her white shoulders and down her back almost to her waist Around her brows was a slim golden crown Her smile was shy and sweet A lovely girl thought Tyrion and a kinder fate than my nephew deserves
