When he was gone Chella gave a snort and Shae wrinkled up her pretty face The rich man lives Doesn’t he

Tyrion sipped at his wine thoughtful Perhaps Or not That would depend on the sellsword it seems He set down his cup Come let’s go upstairs

She had to wait for him at the top of the steps for her legs were slim and supple while his were short and stunted and full of aches But she was smiling when he reached her Did you miss me she teased as she took his hand

Desperately Tyrion admitted Shae only stood a shade over five feet yet still he must look up to her… but in her case he found he did not mind She was sweet to look up at

You’ll miss me all the time in your Red Keep she said as she led him to her room All alone in your cold bed in your Tower of the Hand

Too true Tyrion would gladly have kept her with him but his lord father had forbidden it You will not take the whore to court Lord Tywin had commanded Bringing her to the city was as much defiance as he dared All his authority derived from his father the girl had to understand that You won’t be far he promised You’ll have a house with guards and servants and I’ll visit as often as I’m able

Shae kicked shut the door Through the cloudy panes of the narrow window he could make out the Great Sept of Baelor crowning Visenya’s Hill but Tyrion was distracted by a different sight Bending Shae took her gown by the hem drew it over her head and tossed it aside She did not believe in smallclothes You’ll never be able to rest she said as she stood before him pink and nude and lovely one hand braced on her hip You’ll think of me every time you go to bed Then you’ll get hard and you’ll have no one to help you and you’ll never be able to sleep unless you—she grinned that wicked grin Tyrion liked so well—is that why they call it the Tower of the Hand m’lord

Be quiet and kiss me he commanded

He could taste the wine on her lips and feel her small firm breasts pressed against him as her fingers moved to the lacings of his breeches My lion she whispered when he broke off the kiss to undress My sweet lord my giant of Lannister Tyrion pushed her toward the bed When he entered her she screamed loud enough to wake Baelor the Blessed in his tomb and her nails left gouges in his back He’d never had a pain he liked half so well

Fool he thought to himself afterward as they lay in the center of the sagging mattress amidst the rumpled sheets Will you never learn dwarf She’s a whore damn you it’s your coin she loves not your cock Remember Tysha Yet when his fingers trailed lightly over one nipple it stiffened at the touch and he could see the mark on her breast where he’d bitten her in his passion

So what will you do m’lord now that you’re the Hand of the King Shae asked him as he cupped that warm sweet flesh

Something Cersei will never expect Tyrion murmured softly against her slender neck I’ll do… justice





BRAN

Bran preferred the hard stone of the window seat to the comforts of his featherbed and blankets Abed the walls pressed close and the ceiling hung heavy above him abed the room was his cell and Winterfell his prison Yet outside his window the wide world still called

He could not walk nor climb nor hunt nor fight with a wooden sword as once he had but he could still look He liked to watch the windows begin to glow all over Winterfell as candles and hearth fires were lit behind the diamond-shaped panes of tower and hall and he loved to listen to the direwolves sing to the stars

Of late he often dreamed of wolves They are talking to me brother to brother he told himself when the direwolves howled He could almost understand them… not quite not truly but almost… as if they were singing in a language he had once known and somehow forgotten The Walders might be scared of them but the Starks had wolf blood Old Nan told him so Though it is stronger in some than in others she warned

Summer’s howls were long and sad full of grief and longing Shaggydog’s were more savage Their voices echoed through the yards and halls until the castle rang and it seemed as though some great pack of direwolves haunted Winterfell instead of only two… two where there had once been six Do they miss their brothers and sisters too Bran wondered Are they calling to Grey Wind and Ghost to Nymeria and Lady’s Shade Do they want them to come home and be a pack together

Who can know the mind of a wolf Ser Rodrik Cassel said when Bran asked him why they howled Bran’s lady mother had named him castellan of Winterfell in her absence and his duties left him little time for idle questions

It’s freedom they’re calling for declared Farlen who was kennelmaster and had no more love for the direwolves than his hounds did They don’t like being walled up and who’s to blame them Wild things belong in the wild not in a castle

They want to hunt agreed Gage the cook as he tossed cubes of suet in a great kettle of stew A wolf smells better’n any man Like as not they’ve caught the scent o’ prey

Maester Luwin did not think so Wolves often howl at the moon These are howling at the comet See how bright it is Bran Perchance they think it is the moon

When Bran repeated that to Osha she laughed aloud Your wolves have more wit than your maester the wildling woman said They know truths the grey man has forgotten The way she said it made him shiver and when he asked what the comet meant she answered Blood and fire boy and nothing sweet

Bran asked Septon Chayle about the comet while they were sorting through some scrolls snatched from the library fire It is the sword that slays the season he replied and soon after the white raven came from Oldtown bringing word of autumn so doubtless he was right

Though Old Nan did not think so and she’d lived longer than any of them Dragons she said lifting her head and sniffing She was near blind and could not see the comet yet she claimed she could smell it It be dragons boy she insisted Bran got no princes from Nan no more than he ever had

Hodor said only Hodor That was all he ever said
