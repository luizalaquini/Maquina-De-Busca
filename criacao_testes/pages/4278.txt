logical
criteria for identifying phonemes
rh Categories of speech sounds
A phoneme is defined as a set of sounds whose members to not discriminate
between any words in the language under consideration
The phonemes themselves can be classified into groups which reflect
similarities between them
This can be done in many different ways using various criteria
for classification  In fact one branch of linguistic research
is concerned with defining a set of distinctive
features such that a phoneme class is uniquely identified by
the values of the features  Distinctive features are binary
and include such things as voicedemunvoiced fricativeemnot fricative
aspiratedemunaspirated  We will not be concerned here with such
detailed classifications but it is as well to know that they exist

There is an everyday distinction between vowels and consonants
A vowel forms the nucleus of every syllable and one or more consonants
may optionally surround the vowel
But the distinction sometimes becomes a little ambiguous
Syllables like
ul
sh
are commonly uttered and certainly do not
contain a vowel  Furthermore when we say vowel in everyday
language we usually refer to the
ul
written
vowels a e i o and u there are many more vowel sounds
A vowel in orthography is different to a vowel as a phoneme
Is a diphthong a phonetic vowel  em certainly by the syllable-nucleus
criterion but it is a little different from ordinary vowels because
it is a changing sound rather than a constant one

Table 22 shows one classification of the phonemes of Table 21 which
will be useful in our later studies of speech synthesis from phonetics
It shows twelve vowels including the rather peculiar one
ul
uh
which corresponds to the first vowel in the word above
This is the sound produced by the vocal tract when it is in a relaxed
neutral position and it never occurs in prominent stressed
syllables  The vowels later in the list are almost always longer
than the earlier ones  In fact the first six
c
ul
uh a e i o uc

are often called short vowels and the last five
c
ul
ee er uu ar awc

long ones  The shortness or longness of the one in the middle
c
ul
aac

is rather ambiguous
