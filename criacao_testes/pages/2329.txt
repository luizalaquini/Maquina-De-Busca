My lord Pod was at his side Will you be changing I laid out the doublet On your bed For the feast

Feast said Tyrion sourly What feast

The wedding feast Pod missed the sarcasm of course King Joffrey and Lady Margaery Queen Margaery I mean

Tyrion resolved to get very very drunk tonight Very well young Podrick let us go make me festive

Shae was helping Sansa with her hair when they entered the bedchamber Joy and grief he thought when he beheld them there together Laughter and tears Sansa wore a gown of silvery satin trimmed in vair with dagged sleeves that almost touched the floor lined in soft purple felt Shae had arranged her hair artfully in a delicate silver net winking with dark purple gemstones Tyrion had never seen her look more lovely yet she wore sorrow on those long satin sleeves Lady Sansa he told her you shall be the most beautiful woman in the hall tonight

My lord is too kind

My lady said Shae wistfully Couldn’t I come serve at table I so want to see the pigeons fly out of the pie

Sansa looked at her uncertainly The queen has chosen all the servers

And the hall will be too crowded Tyrion had to bite back his annoyance There will be musicians strolling all through the castle though and tables in the outer ward with food and drink for all He inspected his new doublet crimson velvet with padded shoulders and puffed sleeves slashed to show the black satin underlining A handsome garment All it wants is a handsome man to wear it Come Pod help me into this

He had another cup of wine as he dressed then took his wife by the arm and escorted her from the Kitchen Keep to join the river of silk satin and velvet flowing toward the throne room Some guests had gone inside to find their places on the benches Others were milling in front of the doors enjoying the unseasonable warmth of the afternoon Tyrion led Sansa around the yard to perform the necessary courtesies

She is good at this he thought as he watched her tell Lord Gyles that his cough was sounding better compliment Elinor Tyrell on her gown and question Jalabhar Xho about wedding customs in the Summer Isles His cousin Ser Lancel had been brought down by Ser Kevan the first time he’d left his sickbed since the battle He looks ghastly Lancel’s hair had turned white and brittle and he was thin as a stick Without his father beside him holding him up he would surely have collapsed Yet when Sansa praised his valor and said how good it was to see him getting strong again both Lancel and Ser Kevan beamed She would have made Joffrey a good queen and a better wife if he’d had the sense to love her He wondered if his nephew was capable of loving anyone

You do look quite exquisite child Lady Olenna Tyrell told Sansa when she tottered up to them in a cloth-of-gold gown that must have weighed more than she did The wind has been at your hair though The little old woman reached up and fussed at the loose strands tucking them back into place and straightening Sansa’s hair net I was very sorry to hear about your losses she said as she tugged and fiddled Your brother was a terrible traitor I know but if we start killing men at weddings they’ll be even more frightened of marriage than they are presently There that’s better Lady Olenna smiled I am pleased to say I shall be leaving for Highgarden the day after next I have had quite enough of this smelly city thank you Perhaps you would like to accompany me for a little visit whilst the men are off having their war I shall miss my Margaery so dreadfully and all her lovely ladies Your company would be such sweet solace

You are too kind my lady said Sansa but my place is with my lord husband

Lady Olenna gave Tyrion a wrinkled toothless smile Oh Forgive a silly old woman my lord I did not mean to steal your lovely wife I assumed you would be off leading a Lannister host against some wicked foe

A host of dragons and stags The master of coin must remain at court to see that all the armies are paid for

To be sure Dragons and stags that’s very clever And dwarf’s pennies as well I have heard of these dwarf’s pennies No doubt collecting those is such a dreadful chore

I leave the collecting to others my lady

Oh do you I would have thought you might want to tend to it yourself We can’t have the crown being cheated of its dwarf’s pennies now Can we

Gods forbid Tyrion was beginning to wonder whether Lord Luthor Tyrell had ridden off that cliff intentionally If you will excuse us Lady Olenna it is time we were in our places

Myself as well Seventy-seven courses I daresay Don’t you find that a bit excessive my lord I shan’t eat more than three or four bites myself but you and I are very little aren’t we She patted Sansa’s hair again and said Well off with you child and try to be merrier Now where have my guardsmen gone Left Right where are you Come help me to the dais

Although evenfall was still an hour away the throne room was already a blaze of light with torches burning in every sconce The guests stood along the tables as heralds called out the names and titles of the lords and ladies making their entrance Pages in the royal livery escorted them down the broad central aisle The gallery above was packed with musicians drummers and pipers and fiddlers strings and horns and skins

Tyrion clutched Sansa’s arm and made the walk with a heavy waddling stride He could feel their eyes on him picking at the fresh new scar that had left him even uglier than he had been before Let them look he thought as he hopped up onto his seat Let them stare and whisper until they’ve had their fill I will not hide myself for their sake The Queen of Thorns followed them in shuffling along with tiny little steps Tyrion wondered which of them looked more absurd him with Sansa or the wizened little woman between her seven-foot-tall twin guardsmen

Joffrey and Margaery rode into the throne room on matched white chargers Pages ran before them scattering rose petals under their hooves The king and queen had changed for the feast as well Joffrey wore striped black-and-crimson breeches and a cloth-of-gold doublet with black satin sleeves and onyx studs Margaery had exchanged the demure gown that she had worn in the sept for one much more revealing a confection in pale green samite with a tight-laced bodice that bared her shoulders and the tops of her small breasts Unbound her soft brown hair tumbled over her white shoulders and down her back almost to her waist Around her brows was a slim golden crown Her smile was shy and sweet A lovely girl thought Tyrion and a kinder fate than my nephew deserves

The Kingsguard escorted them onto the dais to the seats of honor beneath the shadow of the Iron Throne draped for the occasion in long silk streamers of Baratheon gold Lannister crimson and Tyrell green Cersei embraced Margaery and kissed her cheeks Lord Tywin did the same and then Lancel and Ser Kevan Joffrey received loving kisses from the bride’s father and his two new brothers Loras and Garlan No one seemed in any great rush to kiss Tyrion When the king and queen had taken their seats the High Septon rose to lead a prayer At least he does not drone as badly as the last one Tyrion consoled himself

He and Sansa had been seated far to the king’s right beside Ser Garlan Tyrell and his wife the Lady Leonette A dozen others sat closer to Joffrey which a pricklier man might have taken for a slight given that he had been the King’s Hand only a short time past Tyrion would have been glad if there had been a hundred

Let the cups be filled Joffrey proclaimed when the gods had been given their due His cupbearer poured a whole flagon of dark Arbor red into the golden wedding chalice that Lord Tyrell had given him that morning The king had to use both hands to lift it To my wife the queen

Margaery the hall shouted back at him Margaery Margaery To the queen A thousand cups rang together and the wedding feast was well and truly begun Tyrion Lannister drank with the rest emptying his cup on that first toast and signaling for it to be refilled as soon as he was seated again

The first dish was a creamy soup of mushrooms and buttered snails served in gilded bowls Tyrion had scarcely touched the breakfast and the wine had already gone to his head so the food was welcome He finished quickly One done seventy-six to come Seventy-seven dishes while there are still starving children in this city and men who would kill for a radish They might not love the Tyrells half so well if they could see us now

Sansa tasted a spoonful of soup and pushed the bowl away Not to your liking my lady Tyrion asked

There’s to be so much my lord I have a little tummy She fiddled nervously with her hair and looked down the table to where Joffrey sat with his Tyrell queen

Does she wish it were her in Margaery’s place Tyrion frowned Even a child should have better sense He turned away wanting distraction but everywhere he looked were women fair fine beautiful happy women who belonged to other men Margaery of course smiling sweetly as she and Joffrey shared a drink from the great seven-sided wedding chalice Her mother Lady Alerie silver-haired and handsome still proud beside Mace Tyrell The queen’s three young cousins bright as birds Lord Merryweather’s dark-haired Myrish wife with her big black sultry eyes Ellaria Sand among the Dornishmen Cersei had placed them at their own table just below the dais in a place of high honor but as far from the Tyrells as the width of the hall would allow laughing at something the Red Viper had told her

And there was one woman sitting almost at the foot of the third table on the left    the wife of one of the Fossoways he thought and heavy with his child Her delicate beauty was in no way diminished by her belly nor was her pleasure in the food and frolics Tyrion watched as her husband fed her morsels off his plate They drank from the same cup and would kiss often and unpredictably Whenever they did his hand would gently rest upon her stomach a tender and protective gesture

He wondered what Sansa would do if he leaned over and kissed her right now Flinch away most likely Or be brave and suffer through it as was her duty She is nothing if not dutiful this wife of mine If he told her that he wished to have her maidenhead tonight she would suffer that dutifully as well and weep no more than she had to

He called for more wine By the time he got it the second course was being served a pstry coffyn filled with pork pine nuts and eggs Sansa ate no more than a bite of hers as the heralds were summoning the first of the seven singers

Grey-bearded Hamish the Harper announced that he would perform for the ears of gods and men a song ne’er heard before in all the Seven Kingdoms He called it Lord Renly’s Ride

His fingers moved across the strings of the high harp filling the throne room with sweet sound From his throne of bones the Lord of Death looked down on the murdered lord Hamish began and went on to tell how Renly repenting his attempt to usurp his nephew’s crown had defied the Lord of Death himself and crossed back to the land of the living to defend the realm against his brother

And for this poor Symon wound up in a bowl of brown Tyrion mused Queen Margaery was teary-eyed by the end when the shade of brave Lord Renly flew to Highgarden to steal one last look at his true love’s face Renly Baratheon never repented of anything in his life the Imp told Sansa but if I’m any judge Hamish just won himself a gilded lute

The Harper also gave them several more familiar songs A Rose of Gold was for the Tyrells no doubt as The Rains of Castamere was meant to flatter his father Maiden Mother and Crone delighted the High Septon and My Lady Wife pleased all the little girls with romance in their hearts and no doubt some little boys as well Tyrion listened with half a ear as he sampled sweetcorn fritters and hot oatbread baked with bits of date apple and orange and gnawed on the rib of a wild boar

Thereafter dishes and diversions succeeded one another in a staggering profusion buoyed along upon a flood of wine and ale Hamish left them his place taken by a smallish elderly bear who danced clumsily to pipe and drum while the wedding guests ate trout cooked in a crust of crushed almonds Moon Boy mounted his stilts and strode around the tables in pursuit of Lord Tyrell’s ludicrously fat fool Butterbumps and the lords and ladies sampled roast herons and cheese-and-onion pies A troupe of Pentoshi tumblers performed cartwheels and handstands balanced platters on their bare feet and stood upon each other’s shoulders to form a pyramid Their feats were accompanied by crabs boiled in fiery eastern spices trenchers filled with chunks of chopped mutton stewed in almond milk with carrots raisins and onions and fish tarts fresh from the ovens served so hot they burned the fingers

Then the heralds summoned another singer Collio Quaynis of Tyrosh who had a vermilion beard and an accent as ludicrous as Symon had promised Collio began with his version of The Dance of the Dragons which was more properly a song for two singers male and female Tyrion suffered through it with a double helping of honey-ginger partridge and several cups of wine A haunting ballad of two dying lovers amidst the Doom of Valyria might have pleased the hall more if Collio had not sung it in High Valyrian which most of the guests could not speak But Bessa the Barmaid won them back with its ribald lyrics Peacocks were served in their plumage roasted whole and stuffed with dates while Collio summoned a drummer bowed low before Lord Tywin and launched into The Rains of Castamere

If I have to hear seven versions of that I may go down to Flea Bottom and apologize to the stew Tyrion turned to his wife So which did you prefer

Sansa blinked at him My lord

The singers Which did you prefer

I    I’m sorry my lord I was not listening

She was not eating either Sansa is aught amiss He spoke without thinking and instantly felt the fool All her kin are slaughtered and she’s wed to me and I wonder what’s amiss

No my lord She looked away from him and feigned an unconvincing interest in Moon Boy pelting Ser Dontos with dates

Four master pyromancers conjured up beasts of living flame to tear at each other with fiery claws whilst the serving men ladeled out bowls of blandissory a mixture of beef broth and boiled wine sweetened with honey and dotted with blanched almonds and chunks of capon Then came some strolling pipers and clever dogs and sword swallowers with buttered pease chopped nuts and slivers of swan poached in a sauce of saffron and peaches Not swan again Tyrion muttered remembering his supper with his sister on the eve of battle A juggler kept a half-dozen swords and axes whirling through the air as skewers of blood sausage were brought sizzling to the tables a juxtaposition that Tyrion thought passing clever though not perhaps in the best of taste

The heralds blew their trumpets To sing for the golden lute one cried we give you Galyeon of Cuy

Galyeon was a big barrel-chested man with a black beard a bald head and a thunderous voice that filled every corner of the throne room He brought no fewer than six musicians to play for him Noble lords and ladies fair I sing but one song for you this night he announced It is the song of the Blackwater and how a realm was saved The drummer began a slow ominous beat

The dark lord brooded high in his tower Galyeon began in a castle as black as the night
