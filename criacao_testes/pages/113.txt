Yoren eyed Arya One best spoken in private m’lord begging your pardons

As you say Desmond see my daughter to her chambers He kissed her on the brow We’ll finish our talk on the morrow

Arya stood rooted to the spot Nothing bad’s happened to Jon has it she asked Yoren Or Uncle Benjen

Well as to Stark I can’t say The Snow boy was well enough when I left the Wall It’s not them as concerns me

Desmond took her hand Come along milady You heard your lord father

Arya had no choice but to go with him wishing it had been Fat Tom With Tom she might have been able to linger at the door on some excuse and hear what Yoren was saying but Desmond was too single-minded to trick How many guards does my father have she asked him as they descended to her bedchamber

Here at King’s Landing Fifty

You wouldn’t let anyone kill him would you she asked

Desmond laughed No fear on that count little lady Lord Eddard’s guarded night and day He’ll come to no harm

The Lannisters have more than fifty men Arya pointed out

So they do but every northerner is worth ten of these southron swords so you can sleep easy

What if a wizard was sent to kill him

Well as to that Desmond replied drawing his longsword wizards die the same as other men once you cut their heads off





EDDARD

Robert I beg of you Ned pleaded hear what you are saying You are talking of murdering a child

The whore is pregnant The king’s fist slammed down on the council table loud as a thunderclap I warned you this would happen Ned Back in the barrowlands I warned you but you did not care to hear it Well you’ll hear it now I want them dead mother and child both and that fool Viserys as well Is that plain enough for you I want them dead

The other councillors were all doing their best to pretend that they were somewhere else No doubt they were wiser than he was Eddard Stark had seldom felt quite so alone You will dishonor yourself forever if you do this

Then let it be on my head so long as it is done I am not so blind that I cannot see the shadow of the axe when it is hanging over my own neck

There is no axe Ned told his king Only the shadow of a shadow twenty years removed… if it exists at all

If Varys asked softly wringing powdered hands together My lord you wrong me Would I bring ties to king and council

Ned looked at the eunuch coldly You would bring us the whisperings of a traitor half a world away my lord Perhaps Mormont is wrong Perhaps he is lying

Ser Jorah would not dare deceive me Varys said with a sly smile Rely on it my lord The princess is with child

So you say If you are wrong we need not fear If the girl miscarries we need not fear If she births a daughter in place of a son we need not fear If the babe dies in infancy we need not fear

But if it is a boy Robert insisted If he lives

The narrow sea would still lie between us I shall fear the Dothraki the day they teach their horses to run on water
