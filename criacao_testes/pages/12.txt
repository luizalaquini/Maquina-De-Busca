EDDARD

The visitors poured through the castle gates in a river of gold and silver and polished steel three hundred strong a pride of bannermen and knights of sworn swords and freeriders Over their heads a dozen golden banners whipped back and forth in the northern wind emblazoned with the crowned stag of Baratheon

Ned knew many of the riders There came Ser Jaime Lannister with hair as bright as beaten gold and there Sandor Clegane with his terrible burned face The tall boy beside him could only be the crown prince and that stunted little man behind them was surely the Imp Tyrion Lannister

Yet the huge man at the head of the column flanked by two knights in the snow-white cloaks of the Kingsguard seemed almost a stranger to Ned… until he vaulted off the back of his warhorse with a familiar roar and crushed him in a bone-crunching hug Ned Ah but it is good to see that frozen face of yours The king looked him over top to bottom and laughed You have not changed at all

Would that Ned had been able to say the same Fifteen years past when they had ridden forth to win a throne the Lord of Storm’s End had been clean-shaven clear-eyed and muscled like a maiden’s fantasy Six and a half feet tall he towered over lesser men and when he donned his armor and the great antlered helmet of his House he became a veritable giant He’d had a giant’s strength too his weapon of choice a spiked iron warhammer that Ned could scarcely lift In those days the smell of leather and blood had clung to him like perfume

Now it was perfume that clung to him like perfume and he had a girth to match his height Ned had last seen the king nine years before during Balon Greyjoy’s rebellion when the stag and the direwolf had joined to end the pretensions of the self-proclaimed King of the Iron Islands Since the night they had stood side by side in Greyjoy’s fallen stronghold where Robert had accepted the rebel lord’s surrender and Ned had taken his son Theon as hostage and ward the king had gained at least eight stone A beard as coarse and black as iron wire covered his jaw to hide his double chin and the sag of the royal jowls but nothing could hide his stomach or the dark circles under his eyes

Yet Robert was Ned’s king now and not just a friend so he said only Your Grace Winterfell is yours

By then the others were dismounting as well and grooms were coming forward for their mounts Robert’s queen Cersei Lannister entered on foot with her younger children The wheelhouse in which they had ridden a huge double-decked carriage of oiled oak and gilded metal pulled by forty heavy draft horses was too wide to pass through the castle gate Ned knelt in the snow to kiss the queen’s ring while Robert embraced Catelyn like a long-lost sister Then the children had been brought forward introduced and approved of by both sides

No sooner had those formalities of greeting been completed than the king had said to his host Take me down to your crypt Eddard I would pay my respects

Ned loved him for that for remembering her still after all these years He called for a lantern No other words were needed The queen had begun to protest They had been riding since dawn everyone was tired and cold surely they should refresh themselves first The dead would wait She had said no more than that Robert had looked at her and her twin brother Jaime had taken her quietly by the arm and she had said no more

They went down to the crypt together Ned and this king he scarcely recognized The winding stone steps were narrow Ned went first with the lantern I was starting to think we would never reach Winterfell Robert complained as they descended In the south the way they talk about my Seven Kingdoms a man forgets that your part is as big as the other six combined

I trust you enjoyed the journey Your Grace

Robert snorted Bogs and forests and fields and scarcely a decent inn north of the Neck I’ve never seen such a vast emptiness Where are all your people

Likely they were too shy to come out Ned jested He could feel the chill coming up the stairs a cold breath from deep within the earth Kings are a rare sight in the north

Robert snorted More likely they were hiding under the snow Snow Ned The king put one hand on the wall to steady himself as they descended

Late summer snows are common enough Ned said I hope they did not trouble you They are usually mild

The Others take your mild snows Robert swore What will this place be like in winter I shudder to think

The winters are hard Ned admitted But the Starks will endure We always have

You need to come south Robert told him You need a taste of summer before it flees In Highgarden there are fields of golden roses that stretch away as far as the eye can see The fruits are so ripe they explode in your mouth—melons peaches fireplums you’ve never tasted such sweetness You’ll see I brought you some Even at Storm’s End with that good wind off the bay the days are so hot you can barely move And you ought to see the towns Ned Flowers everywhere the markets bursting with food the summerwines so cheap and so good that you can get drunk just breathing the air Everyone is fat and drunk and rich He laughed and slapped his own ample stomach a thump And the girls Ned he exclaimed his eyes sparkling I swear women lose all modesty in the heat They swim naked in the river right beneath the castle Even in the streets it’s too damn hot for wool or fur so they go around in these short gowns silk if they have the silver and cotton if not but it’s all the same when they start sweating and the cloth sticks to their skin they might as well be naked The king laughed happily

Robert Baratheon had always been a man of huge appetites a man who knew how to take his pleasures That was not a charge anyone could lay at the door of Eddard Stark Yet Ned could not help but notice that those pleasures were taking a toll on the king Robert was breathing heavily by the time they reached the bottom of the stairs his face red in the lantern light as they stepped out into the darkness of the crypt

Your Grace Ned said respectfully He swept the lantern in a wide semicircle Shadows moved and lurched Flickering light touched the stones underfoot and brushed against a long procession of granite pillars that marched ahead two by two into the dark Between the pillars the dead sat on their stone thrones against the walls backs against the sepulchres that contained their mortal remains She is down at the end with Father and Brandon

He led the way between the pillars and Robert followed wordlessly shivering in the subterranean chill It was always cold down here Their footsteps rang off the stones and echoed in the vault overhead as they walked among the dead of House Stark The Lords of Winterfell watched them pass Their likenesses were carved into the stones that sealed the tombs In long rows they sat blind eyes staring out into eternal darkness while great stone direwolves curled round their feet The shifting shadows made the stone figures seem to stir as the living passed by

By ancient custom an iron longsword had been laid across the lap of each who had been Lord of Winterfell to keep the vengeful spirits in their crypts The oldest had long ago rusted away to nothing leaving only a few red stains where the metal had rested on stone Ned wondered if that meant those ghosts were free to roam the castle now He hoped not The first Lords of Winterfell had been men hard as the land they ruled In the centuries before the Dragonlords came over the sea they had sworn allegiance to no man styling themselves the Kings in the North

Ned stopped at last and lifted the oil lantern The crypt continued on into darkness ahead of them but beyond this point the tombs were empty and unsealed black holes waiting for their dead waiting for him and his children Ned did not like to think on that Here he told his king

Robert nodded silently knelt and bowed his head
