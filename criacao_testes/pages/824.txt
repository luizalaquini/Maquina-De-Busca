After they had finished Sam begged her pardon and went out to relieve himself and look after the horse A biting wind was blowing from the north and the leaves in the trees rattled at him as he passed He had to break the thin scum of ice on top of the stream so the horse could get a drink I had better bring her inside He did not want to wake up at break of day to find that their horse had frozen to death during the night Gilly would keep going even if that happened The girl was very brave not like him He wished he knew what he was going to do with her back at Castle Black She kept saying how she’d be his wife if he wanted but black brothers didn’t keep wives besides he was a Tarly of Horn Hill he could never wed a wildling I’ll have to think of something So long as we reach the Wall alive the rest doesn’t matter it doesn’t matter one little bit

Leading the horse to the longhall was simple enough Getting her through the door was not but Sam persisted Gilly was already dozing by the time he got the garron inside He hobbled the horse in a corner fed some fresh wood to the fire took off his heavy cloak and wriggled down under the furs beside the wildling woman His cloak was big enough to cover all three of them and keep in the warmth of their bodies

Gilly smelled of milk and garlic and musty old fur but he was used to that by now They were good smells so far as Sam was concerned He liked sleeping next to her It made him remember times long past when he had shared a huge bed at Horn Hill with two of his sisters That had ended when Lord Randyll decided it was making him soft as a girl Sleeping alone in my own cold cell never made me any harder or braver though He wondered what his father would say if he could see him now I killed one of the Others my lord he imagined saying I stabbed him with an obsidian dagger and my Sworn Brothers call me Sam the Slayer now But even in his fancies Lord Randyll only scowled disbelieving

His dreams were strange that night He was back at Horn Hill at the castle but his father was not there It was Sam’s castle now Jon Snow was with him Lord Mormont too the Old Bear and Grenn and Dolorous Edd and Pyp and Toad and all his other brothers from the Watch but they wore bright colors instead of black Sam sat at the high table and feasted them all cutting thick slices off a roast with his father’s greatsword Heartsbane There were sweet cakes to eat and honeyed wine to drink there was singing and dancing and everyone was warm When the feast was done he went up to sleep not to the lord’s bedchamber where his mother and father lived but to the room he had once shared with his sisters Only instead of his sisters it was Gilly waiting in the huge soft bed wearing nothing but a big shaggy fur milk leaking from her breasts

He woke suddenly in cold and dread

The fire had burned down to smouldering red embers The air itself seemed frozen it was so cold In the corner the garron was whinnying and kicking the logs with her hind legs Gilly sat beside the fire hugging her babe Sam sat up groggy his breath puffing pale from his open mouth The longball was dark with shadows black and blacker The hair on his arms was standing up

It’s nothing he told himself I’m cold that’s all

Then by the door one of the shadows moved A big one

This is still a dream Sam prayed Oh make it that I’m still asleep make it a nightmare He’s dead he’s dead I saw him die He’s come for the babe Gilly wept He smells him A babe fresh-born stinks o’ life He’s come for the life

The huge dark shape stooped under the lintel into the hall and shambled toward them In the dim light of the fire the shadow became Small Paul

Go away Sam croaked We don’t want you here

Paul’s hands were coal his face was milk his eyes shone a bitter blue Hoarfrost whitened his beard and on one shoulder hunched a raven pecking at his cheek eating the dead white flesh Sam’s bladder let go and he felt the warmth running down his legs Gilly calm the horse and lead her out You do that

You— she started

I have the knife The dragonglass dagger He fumbled it out as he got to his feet He’d given the first knife to Grenn but thankfully he’d remembered to take Lord Mormont’s dagger before fleeing Craster’s Keep He clutched it tight moving away from the fire away from Gilly and the babe Paul He meant to sound brave but it came out in a squeak Small Paul Do you know me I’m Sam fat Sam Sam the Scared you saved me in the woods You carried me when I couldn’t walk another step No one else could have done that but you did Sam backed away knife in hand sniveling I am such a coward Don’t hurt us Paul Please Why would you want to hurt us

Gilly scrabbled backward across the hard dirt floor The wight turned his head to look at her but Sam shouted NO and he turned back The raven on his shoulder ripped a strip of flesh from his pale ruined cheek Sam held the dagger before him breathing like a blacksmith’s bellows Across the longhall Gilly reached the garron Gods give me courage Sam prayed For once give me a little courage Just long enough for her to get away

Small Paul moved toward him Sam backed off until he came up against a rough log wall He clutched the dagger with both hands to hold it steady The wight did not seem to fear the dragonglass Perhaps he did not know what it was He moved slowly but Small Paul had never been quick even when he’d been alive Behind him Gilly murmured to calm the garron and tried to urge it toward the door But the horse must have caught a whiff of the wight’s queer cold scent Suddenly she balked rearing her hooves lashing at the frosty air Paul swung toward the sound and seemed to lose all interest in Sam

There was no time to think or pray or be afraid Samwell Tarly threw himself forward and plunged the dagger down into Small Paul’s back Half-turned the wight never saw him coming The raven gave a shriek and took to the air You’re dead Sam screamed as he stabbed You’re dead you’re dead He stabbed and screamed again and again tearing huge rents in Paul’s heavy black cloak Shards of dragonglass flew everywhere as the blade shattered on the iron mail beneath the wool

Sam’s wail made a white mist in the black air He dropped the useless hilt and took a hasty step backwards as Small Paul twisted around Before he could get out his other knife the steel knife that every brother carried the wight’s black hands locked beneath his chins Paul’s fingers were so cold they seemed to burn They burrowed deep into the soft flesh of Sam’s throat Run Gilly run he wanted to scream but when he opened his mouth only a choking sound emerged

His fumbling fingers finally found the dagger but when he slammed it up into the wight’s belly the point skidded off the iron links and the blade went spinning from Sam’s hand Small Paul’s fingers tightened inexorably and began to twist He’s going to rip my head off Sam thought in despair His throat felt frozen his lungs on fire He punched and pulled at the wight’s wrists to no avail He kicked Paul between the legs uselessly The world shrank to two blue stars a terrible crushing pain and a cold so fierce that his tears froze over his eyes Sam squirmed and pulled desperate… and then he lurched forward

Small Paul was big and powerful but Sam still outweighed him and the wights were clumsy he had seen that on the Fist The sudden shift sent Paul staggering back a step and the living man and the dead one went crashing down together The impact knocked one hand from Sam’s throat and he was able to suck in a quick breath of air before the icy black fingers returned The taste of blood filled his mouth He twisted his neck around looking for his knife and saw a dull orange glow The fire Only ember and ashes remained but still… he could not breathe or think… Sam wrenched himself sideways pulling Paul with him… his arms flailed against the dirt floor groping reaching scattering the ashes until at last they found something hot… a chunk of charred wood smouldering red and orange within the black… his fingers closed around it and he smashed it into Paul’s mouth so hard he felt teeth shatter

Yet even so the wight’s grip did not loosen Sam’s last thoughts were for the mother who had loved him and the father he had failed The longhall was spinning around him when he saw the wisp of smoke rising from between Paul’s broken teeth Then the dead man’s face burst into flame and the hands were gone

Sam sucked in air and rolled feebly away The wight was burning hoarfrost dripping from his beard as the flesh beneath blackened Sam heard the raven shriek but Paul himself made no sound When his mouth opened only flames came out And his eyes… It’s gone the blue glow is gone

He crept to the door The air was so cold that it hurt to breathe but such a fine sweet hurt He ducked from the longhall Gilly he called Gilly I killed it Gil—

She stood with her back against the weirwood the boy in her arms The wights were all around her There were a dozen of them a score more… some had been wildlings once and still wore skins and hides… but more had been his brothers Sam saw Lark the Sisterman Softfoot Ryles The wen on Chett’s neck was black his boils covered with a thin film of ice And that one looked like Hake though it was hard to know for certain with half his head missing They had torn the poor garron apart and were pulling out her entrails with dripping red hands Pale steam rose from her belly

Sam made a whimpery sound It’s not fair…

Fair The raven landed on his shoulder Fair far fear It flapped its wings and screamed along with Gilly The wights were almost on her He heard the dark red leaves of the weirwood rustling whispering to one another in a tongue he did not know The starlight itself seemed to stir and all around them the trees groaned and creaked Sam Tarly turned the color of curdled milk and his eyes went wide as plates Ravens They were in the weirwood hundreds of them thousands perched on the bone-white branches peering between the leaves He saw their beaks open as they screamed saw them spread their black wings Shrieking flapping they descended on the wights in angry clouds They swarmed round Chett’s face and pecked at his blue eyes they covered the Sisterman like flies they plucked gobbets from inside Hake’s shattered head There were so many that when Sam looked up he could not see the moon

Go said the bird on his shoulder Go go go
