The honor is mine Quhuru Mo said Dany in the same language Have you come from the Summer Isles

This is so Your Grace but before not half a year past we called at Oldtown From there I bring you a wondrous gift

A gift

A gift of news Dragonmother Stormborn I tell you true Robert Baratheon is dead

Outside her walls dusk was settling over Qarth but a sun had risen in Dany’s heart Dead she repeated In her lap black Drogon hissed and pale smoke rose before her face like a veil You are certain The Usurper is dead

So it is said in Oldtown and Dorne and Lys and all the other ports where we have called

He sent me poisoned wine yet I live and he is gone What was the manner of his death On her shoulder pale Viserion flapped wings the color of cream stirring the air

Torn by a monstrous boar whilst hunting in his kingswood or so I heard in Oldtown Others say his queen betrayed him or his brother or Lord Stark who was his Hand Yet all the tales agree in this King Robert is dead and in his grave

Dany had never looked upon the Usurper’s face yet seldom a day had passed when she had not thought of him His great shadow had lain across her since the hour of her birth when she came forth amidst blood and storm into a world where she no longer had a place And now this ebony stranger had lifted that shadow

The boy sits the Iron Throne now Ser Jorah said

King Joffrey reigns Quhuru Mo agreed but the Lannisters rule Robert’s brothers have fled King’s Landing The talk is they mean to claim the crown And the Hand has fallen Lord Stark who was King Robert’s friend He has been seized for treason

Ned Stark a traitor Ser Jorah snorted Not bloody likely The Long Summer will come again before that one would besmirch his precious honor

What honor could he have Dany said He was a traitor to his true king as were these Lannisters It pleased her to hear that the Usurper’s dogs were fighting amongst themselves though she was unsurprised The same thing happened when her Drogo died and his great khalasar tore itself to pieces My brother is dead as well Viserys who was the true king she told the Summer Islander Khal Drogo my lord husband killed him with a crown of molten gold Would her brother have been any wiser had he known that the vengeance he had prayed for was so close at hand

Then I grieve for you Dragonmother and for bleeding Westeros bereft of its rightful king

Beneath Dany’s gentle fingers green Rhaegal stared at the stranger with eyes of molten gold When his mouth opened his teeth gleamed like black needles When does your ship return to Westeros Captain

Not for a year or more I fear From here the Cinnamon Wind sails east to make the trader’s circle round the Jade Sea

I see said Dany disappointed I wish you fair winds and good trading then You have brought me a precious gift

I have been amply repaid great queen

She puzzled at that How so

His eyes gleamed I have seen dragons

Dany laughed And will see more of them one day I hope Come to me in King’s Landing when I am on my father’s throne and you shall have a great reward

The Summer Islander promised he would do so and kissed her lightly on the fingers as he took his leave Jhiqui showed him out while Ser Jorah Mormont remained

Khaleesi the knight said when they were alone I should not speak so freely of your plans if I were you This man will spread the tale wherever he goes now

Let him she said Let the whole world know my purpose The Usurper is dead what does it matter

Not every sailor’s tale is true Ser Jorah cautioned and even if Robert be truly dead his son rules in his place This changes nothing truly

This changes everything Dany rose abruptly Screeching her dragons uncoiled and spread their wings Drogon flapped and clawed up to the lintel over the archway The others skittered across the floor wingtips scrabbling on the marble Before the Seven Kingdoms were like my Drogo’s khalasar a hundred thousand made as one by his strength Now they fly to pieces even as the khalasar did after my khal lay dead

The high lords have always fought Tell me who’s won and I’ll tell you what it means Khaleesi the Seven Kingdoms are not going to fall into your hands like so many ripe peaches You will need a fleet gold armies alliances—

All this I know She took his hands in hers and looked up into his dark suspicious eyes Sometimes he thinks of me as a child he must protect and sometimes as a woman he would like to bed but does he ever truly see me as his queen I am not the frightened girl you met in Pentos I have counted only fifteen name days true… but I am as old as the crones in the dosh khaleen and as young as my dragons Jorah I have borne a child burned a khal and crossed the red waste and the Dothraki sea Mine is the blood of the dragon

As was your brother’s he said stubbornly

I am not Viserys

No he admitted There is more of Rhaegar in you I think but even Rhaegar could be slain Robert proved that on the Trident with no more than a warhammer Even dragons can die

Dragons die She stood on her toes to kiss him lightly on an unshaven cheek But so do dragonslayers





BRAN

Meera moved in a wary circle her net dangling loose in her left hand the slender three-pronged frog spear poised in her right Summer followed her with his golden eyes turning his tail held stiff and tall Watching watching…

Yai the girl shouted the spear darting out The wolf slid to the left and leapt before she could draw back the spear Meera cast her net the tangles unfolding in the air before her Summer’s leap carried him into it He dragged it with him as he slammed into her chest and knocked her over backward Her spear went spinning away The damp grass cushioned her fall but the breath went out of her in an Oof The wolf crouched atop her

Bran hooted You lose

She wins her brother Jojen said Summer’s snared

He was right Bran saw Thrashing and growling at the net trying to rip free Summer was only ensnaring himself worse Nor could he bite through Let him out

Laughing the Reed girl threw her arms around the tangled wolf and rolled them both Summer gave a piteous whine his legs kicking against the cords that bound them Meera knelt undid a twist pulled at a corner tugged deftly here and there and suddenly the direwolf was bounding free

Summer to me Bran spread his arms Watch he said an instant before the wolf bowled into him He clung with all his strength as the wolf dragged him bumping through the grass They wrestled and rolled and clung to each other one snarling and yapping the other laughing In the end it was Bran sprawled on top the mud-spattered direwolf under him Good wolf he panted Summer licked him across the ear

Meera shook her head Does he never grow angry

Not with me Bran grabbed the wolf by his ears and Summer snapped at him fiercely but it was all in play Sometimes he tears my garb but he’s never drawn blood

Your blood you mean If he’d gotten past my net…

He wouldn’t hurt you He knows I like you All of the other lords and knights had departed within a day or two of the harvest feast but the Reeds had stayed to become Bran’s constant companions Jojen was so solemn that Old Nan called him little grandfather but Meera reminded Bran of his sister Arya She wasn’t scared to get dirty and she could run and fight and throw as good as a boy She was older than Arya though almost sixteen a woman grown They were both older than Bran even though his ninth name day had finally come and gone but they never treated him like a child

I wish you were our wards instead of the Walders He began to struggle toward the nearest tree His dragging and wriggling was unseemly to watch but when Meera moved to lift him he said No don’t help me He rolled clumsily and pushed and squirmed backward using the strength of his arms until he was sitting with his back to the trunk of a tall ash See I told you Summer lay down with his head in Bran’s lap I never knew anyone who fought with a net before he told Meera while he scratched the direwolf between the ears Did your master-at-arms teach you net-fighting

My father taught me We have no knights at Greywater No master-at-arms and no maester

Who keeps your ravens

She smiled Ravens can’t find Greywater Watch no more than our enemies can
