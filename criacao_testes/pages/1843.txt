anybody else shall hurt
you But all this wants looking into I perceive
What with one thing and another I see that my work
is well cut out for me
                    v
How do I look to-night Liddy said Bathsheba
giving a final adjustment to her dress before leaving the
glass
I never saw you look so well before Yes-ill tell
you when you looked like it -- that night a year and a
half ago when you came in so wildiike and scolded us
for making remarks about you and Mr Troy
Everybody will think that I am setting myself to
captivate Mr Boldwood I suppose she murmured
At least theyll say so Cant my hair be brushed
down a little flatter I dread going -- yet I dread the
risk of wounding him by staying away
Anyhow maam you cant well be dressed plainer
than you are unless you go in sackcloth at once Tis
your excitement is what makes you look so noticeable
to-night
I dont know whats the matter I feel wretched at
one time and buoyant at another I wish I could have
continued quite alone as I have been for the last year
or so with no hopes and no fears and no pleasure and
no grief
Now just suppose Mr Boldwood should ask you
 -- only just suppose it -- to run away with him what
would you do maam
Liddy -- none of that said Bathsheba gravely
Mind I wont hear joking on any such matter Do
you hear
I beg pardon maam But knowing what rum
things we women be I just said -- however I wont
speak of it again
No marrying for me yet for many a year if ever
twill be for reasons very very different from those you
think or others will believe Now get my cloak for it
is time to go
                        VI
Oak said Boldwood before you go I want to
mention what has been passing in my mind lately --
that little arrangement we made about your share in the
farm I mean That share is small too small consider+
ing how little I attend to business now and how much
time and thought you give to it Well
P 425
since the world
is brightening for me I want to show my sense of it
by increasing yopur proportion in the partnership Ill
make a memorandum of the arrangement which struck
me as likely to be convenient for I havent time to talk
about it now and then well discuss it at our leisure
My intention is ultimately to retire from the manage+
ment altogether and until you can take all the expendi+
ture upon your shoulders Ill be a sleeping partner in
the stock Then if I marry her -- and I hope-i feel I
shall why --  -- 
Pray dont speak of it sir said Oak hastily We
dont know what may happen So many upsets may
befall ee Theres many a slip as they say -- and I
would advise you-i know youll pardon me this once --
not to be 1too sure1
I know I know But the feeling I have about in+
creasing your share is on account of what I know of you
Oak I have learnt a little about your secret your
interest in her is more than that of bailiff for an em+
ployer But you have behaved like a man and I as a
sort of successful rivai-successful partly through your
goodness of heart -- should like definitely to show my
sense of your friendship under what must have been a
great pain to you
O thats not necessary thank ee said Oak
hurriedly I must get used to such as that other
men have and so shall I
Oak then left him He was uneasy on Boldwoods
account for he saw anew that this constant passion
of the farmer made him not the man he once had
been
As Boldwood continued awhile in his room alone --
ready and dressed to receive his company -- the mood of
anxiety about his appearance seemed to pass away and
to be succeeded by a deep solemnity He looked out
of the window and regarded the dim outline of the trees
upon the sky and the twilight deepening to darkness
Then he went to a locked closet and took from
a locked drawer therein a small circular case the size of
a pilibox and was about to put it into his pocket But
he lingered to open the cover and take a momentary
glance inside It contained a womans finger-ring set
all the way round with small

diamonds and from its
appearance had evidently been recently purchased
Boldwoods eyes dwelt upon its many sparkles a long
time though that its material aspect concerned him
little was plain from his manner and mien which were
