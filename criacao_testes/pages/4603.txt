Jon turned

The singer rose to his feet I’m Mance Rayder he said as he put aside the lute And you are Ned Stark’s bastard the Snow of Winterfell

Stunned Jon stood speechless for a moment before he recovered enough to say How    how could you know   

That’s a tale for later said Mance Rayder How did you like the song lad

Well enough I’d heard it before

But what does it matter for all men must die the King-beyond-the-Wall said lightly and I’ve tasted the Dornishman’s wife Tell me does my Lord of Bones speak truly Did you slay my old friend the Halfhand

I did Though it was his doing more than mine

The Shadow Tower will never again seem as fearsome the king said with sadness in his voice Qhorin was my enemy But also my brother once So    shall I thank you for killing him Jon Snow Or curse you He gave Jon a mocking smile

The King-beyond-the-Wall looked nothing like a king nor even much a wildling He was of middling height slender sharp-faced with shrewd brown eyes and long brown hair that had gone mostly to grey There was no crown on his head no gold rings on his arms no jewels at his throat not even a gleam of silver He wore wool and leather and his only garment of note was his ragged black wool cloak its long tears patched with faded red silk

You ought to thank me for killing your enemy Jon said finally and curse me for killing your friend

Har boomed the white-bearded man Well answered

Agreed Mance Rayder beckoned Jon closer If you would join us you’d best know us The man you took for me is Styr Magnar of Thenn Magnar means ‘lord’ in the Old Tongue The earless man stared at Jon coldly as Mance turned to the white-bearded one Our ferocious chicken-eater here is my loyal Tormund The woman—

Tormund rose to his feet Hold You gave Styr his style give me mine

Mance Rayder laughed As you wish Jon Snow before you stands Tormund Giantsbane Tall-talker Horn-blower and Breaker of Ice And here also Tormund Thunderfist Husband to Bears the Mead-king of Ruddy Hall Speaker to Gods and Father of Hosts

That sounds more like me said Tormund Well met Jon Snow I am fond o’ wargs as it happens though not o’ Starks

The good woman at the brazier Mance Rayder went on is Dalla The pregnant woman smiled shyly Treat her like you would any queen she is carrying my child He turned to the last two This beauty is her sister Val Young Jarl beside her is her latest pet

I am no man’s pet said Jarl dark and fierce

And Val’s no man white-bearded Tormund snorted You ought to have noticed that by now lad

So there you have us Jon Snow said Mance Rayder The King-beyond-the-Wall and his court such as it is And now some words from you I think Where did you come from

Winterfell he said by way of Castle Black

And what brings you up the Milkwater so far from the fires of home He did not wait for Jon’s answer but looked at once to Rattleshirt How many were they

Five Three’s dead and the boy’s here T’other went up a mountainside where no horse could follow

Rayder’s eyes met Jon’s again Was it only the five of you Or are more of your brothers skulking about

We were four and the Halfhand Qhorin was worth twenty common men

The King-beyond-the-Wall smiled at that Some thought so Still    a boy from Castle Black with rangers from the Shadow Tower How did that come to be

Jon had his lie all ready The Lord Commander sent me to the Halfhand for seasoning so he took me on his ranging

Styr the Magnar frowned at that Ranging you call it    why would crows come ranging up the Skirling Pass

The villages were deserted Jon said truthfully It was as if all the free folk had vanished

Vanished aye said Mance Rayder And not just the free folk Who told you where we were Jon Snow

Tormund snorted It were Craster or I’m a blushing maid I told you Mance that creature needs to be shorter by a head

The king gave the older man an irritated look Tormund some day try thinking before you speak I know it was Craster I asked Jon to see if he would tell it true

Har Tormund spat Well I stepped in that He grinned at Jon See lad that’s why he’s king and I’m not I can outdrink outfight and outsing him and my member’s thrice the size o’ his but Mance has cunning He was raised a crow you know and the crow’s a tricksy bird

I would speak with the lad alone my Lord of Bones Mance Rayder said to Rattleshirt Leave us all of you

What me as well said Tormund

No you especially said Mance

I eat in no hall where I’m not welcome Tormund got to his feet Me and the hens are leaving He snatched another chicken off the brazier shoved it into a pocket sewn in the lining of his cloak said Har and left licking his fingers The others followed him out all but the woman Dalla

Sit if you like Rayder said when they were gone Are you hungry Tormund left us two birds at least

I would be pleased to eat Your Grace And thank you

Your Grace The king smiled That’s not a style one often hears from the lips of free folk I’m Mance to most The Mance to some Will you take a horn of mead

Gladly said Jon

The king poured himself as Dalla cut the well-crisped hens apart and brought them each a half Jon peeled off his gloves and ate with his fingers sucking every morsel of meat off the bones

Tormund spoke truly said Mance Rayder as he ripped apart a loaf of bread The black crow is a tricksy bird that’s so    but I was a crow when you were no bigger than the babe in Dalla’s belly Jon Snow So take care not to play tricksy with me

As you say Your—Mance

The king laughed Your Mance Why not I promised you a tale before of how I knew you Have you puzzled it out yet

Jon shook his head Did Rattleshirt send word ahead

By wing We have no trained ravens No I knew your face I’ve seen it before Twice

It made no sense at first but as Jon turned it over in his mind dawn broke When you were a brother of the Watch   

Very good Yes that was the first time You were just a boy and I was all in black one of a dozen riding escort to old Lord Commander Qorgyle when he came down to see your father at Winterfell I was walking the wall around the yard when I came on you and your brother Robb It had snowed the night before and the two of you had built a great mountain above the gate and were waiting for someone likely to pass underneath

I remember said Jon with a startled laugh A young black brother on the wallwalk yes    You swore not to tell

And kept my vow That one at least
