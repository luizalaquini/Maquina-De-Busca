And so many others were missing Where had the rest of them gone Sansa wondered Vainly she searched for friendly faces Not one of them would meet her eyes It was as if she had become a ghost dead before her time

Grand Maester Pycelle was seated alone at the council table seemingly asleep his hands clasped together atop his beard She saw Lord Varys hurry into the hall his feet making no sound A moment later Lord Baelish entered through the tall doors in the rear smiling He chatted amiably with Ser Balon and Ser Dontos as he made his way to the front Butterflies fluttered nervously in Sansa’s stomach I shouldn’t be afraid she told herself I have nothing to be afraid of it will all come out well Joff loves me and the queen does too she said so

A herald’s voice rang out All hail His Grace Joffrey of the Houses Baratheon and Lannister the First of his Name King of the Andals the Rhoynar and the First Men and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms All hail his lady mother Cersei of House Lannister Queen Regent Light of the West and Protector of the Realm

Ser Barristan Selmy resplendent in white plate led them in Ser Arys Oakheart escorted the queen while Ser Boros Blount walked beside Joffrey so six of the Kingsguard were now in the hall all the White Swords save Jaime Lannister alone Her prince—no her king now—took the steps of the Iron Throne two at a time while his mother was seated with the council Joff wore plush black velvets slashed with crimson a shimmering cloth-of-gold cape with a high collar and on his head a golden crown crusted with rubies and black diamonds

When Joffrey turned to look out over the hall his eye caught Sansa’s He smiled seated himself and spoke It is a king’s duty to punish the disloyal and reward those who are true Grand Maester Pycelle I command you to read my decrees

Pycelle pushed himself to his feet He was clad in a magnificent robe of thick red velvet with an ermine collar and shiny gold fastenings From a drooping sleeve heavy with gilded scrollwork he drew a parchment unrolled it and began to read a long list of names commanding each in the name of king and council to present themselves and swear their fealty to Joffrey Failing that they would be adjudged traitors their lands and titles forfeit to the throne

The names he read made Sansa hold her breath Lord Stannis Baratheon his lady wife his daughter Lord Renly Baratheon Both Lord Royces and their sons Ser Loras Tyrell Lord Mace Tyrell his brothers uncles sons The red priest Thoros of Myr Lord Beric Dondarrion Lady Lysa Arryn and her son the little Lord Robert Lord Hoster Tully his brother Ser Brynden his son Ser Edmure Lord Jason Mallister Lord Bryce Caron of the Marches Lord Tytos Blackwood Lord Walder Frey and his heir Ser Stevron Lord Karyl Vance Lord Jonos Bracken Lady Sheila Whent Doran Martell Prince of Dorne and all his sons So many she thought as Pycelle read on and on it will take a whole flock of ravens to send out these commands

And at the end near last came the names Sansa had been dreading Lady Catelyn Stark Robb Stark Brandon Stark Rickon Stark Arya Stark Sansa stifled a gasp Arya They wanted Arya to present herself and swear an oath… it must mean her sister had fled on the galley she must be safe at Winterfell by now…

Grand Maester Pycelle rolled up the list tucked it up his left sleeve and pulled another parchment from his right He cleared his throat and resumed In the place of the traitor Eddard Stark it is the wish of His Grace that Tywin Lannister Lord of Casterly Rock and Warden of the West take up the office of Hand of the King to speak with his voice lead his armies against his enemies and carry out his royal will So the king has decreed The small council consents

In the place of the traitor Stannis Baratheon it is the wish of His Grace that his lady mother the Queen Regent Cersei Lannister who has ever been his staunchest support be seated upon his small council that she may help him rule wisely and with justice So the king has decreed The small council consents

Sansa heard a soft murmuring from the lords around her but it was quickly stilled Pycelle continued

It is also the wish of His Grace that his loyal servant Janos Slynt Commander of the City Watch of King’s Landing be at once raised to the rank of lord and granted the ancient seat of Harrenhal with all its attendant lands and incomes and that his sons and grandsons shall hold these honors after him until the end of time It is moreover his command that Lord Slynt be seated immediately upon his small council to assist in the governance of the realm So the king has decreed The small council consents

Sansa glimpsed motion from the corner of her eye as Janos Slynt made his entrance This time the muttering was louder and angrier Proud lords whose houses went back thousands of years made way reluctantly for the balding frog-faced commoner as he marched past Golden scales had been sewn onto the black velvet of his doublet and rang together softly with each step His cloak was checked black-and-gold satin Two ugly boys who must have been his sons went before him struggling with the weight of a heavy metal shield as tall as they were For his sigil he had taken a bloody spear gold on a night-black field The sight of it raised goose prickles up and down Sansa’s arms

As Lord Slynt took his place Grand Maester Pycelle resumed Lastly in these times of treason and turmoil with our beloved Robert so lately dead it is the view of the council that the life and safety of King Joffrey is of paramount importance… He looked to the queen

Cersei stood Ser Barristan Selmy stand forth

Ser Barristan had been standing at the foot of the Iron Throne as still as any statue but now he went to one knee and bowed his head Your Grace I am yours to command

Rise Ser Barristan Cersei Lannister said You may remove your helm

My lady Standing the old knight took off his high white helm though he did not seem to understand why

You have served the realm long and faithfully good ser and every man and woman in the Seven Kingdoms owes you thanks Yet now I fear your service is at an end It is the wish of king and council that you lay down your heavy burden

My… burden I fear I… I do not…

The new-made lord Janos Slynt spoke up his voice heavy and blunt Her Grace is trying to tell you that you are relieved as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard

The tall white-haired knight seemed to shrink as he stood there scarcely breathing Your Grace he said at last The Kingsguard is a Sworn Brotherhood Our vows are taken for life Only death may relieve the Lord Commander of his sacred trust

Whose death Ser Barristan The queen’s voice was soft as silk but her words carried the whole length of the hall Yours or your king’s

You let my father die Joffrey said accusingly from atop the Iron Throne You’re too old to protect anybody

Sansa watched as the knight peered up at his new king She had never seen him look his years before yet now he did Your Grace he said I was chosen for the White Swords in my twenty-third year It was all I had ever dreamed from the moment I first took sword in hand I gave up all claim to my ancestral keep The girl I was to wed married my cousin in my place I had no need of land or sons my life would be lived for the realm Ser Gerold Hightower himself heard my vows… to ward the king with all my strength… to give my blood for his… I fought beside the White Bull and Prince Lewyn of Dorne… beside Ser Arthur Dayne the Sword of the Morning Before I served your father I helped shield King Aerys and his father Jaehaerys before him… three kings…

And all of them dead Littlefinger pointed out

Your time is done Cersei Lannister announced Joffrey requires men around him who are young and strong The council has determined that Ser Jaime Lannister will take your place as the Lord Commander of Sworn Brothers of the White Swords
