I am no stranger to Valyrian steel the boy had boasted The septons were always going on about how the Father Above judges us all If the Father would be so good as to topple over and crush Joff like a dung beetle I might even believe it

He ought to have seen it long ago Jaime would never send another man to do his killing and Cersei was too cunning to use a knife that could be traced back to her but Joff arrogant vicious stupid little wretch that he was…

He remembered a cold morning when he’d climbed down the steep exterior steps from Winterfell’s library to find Prince Joffrey jesting with the Hound about killing wolves Send a dog to kill a wolf he said Even Joffrey was not so foolish as to command Sandor Clegane to slay a son of Eddard Stark however the Hound would have gone to Cersei Instead the boy found his catspaw among the unsavory lot of freeriders merchants and camp followers who’d attached themselves to the king’s party as they made their way north Some poxy lackwit willing to risk his life for a prince’s favor and a little coin Tyrion wondered whose idea it had been to wait until Robert left Winterfell before opening Bran’s throat Joff’s most like No doubt he thought it was the height of cunning

The prince’s own dagger had a jeweled pommel and inlaid goldwork on the blade Tyrion seemed to recall At least Joff had not been stupid enough to use that Instead he went poking among his father’s weapons Robert Baratheon was a man of careless generosity and would have given his son any dagger he wanted… but Tyrion guessed that the boy had just taken it Robert had come to Winterfell with a long tail of knights and retainers a huge wheelhouse and a baggage train No doubt some diligent servant had made certain that the king’s weapons went with him in case he should desire any of them

The blade Joff chose was nice and plain No goldwork no jewels in the hilt no silver inlay on the blade King Robert never wore it had likely forgotten he owned it Yet the Valyrian steel was deadly sharp… sharp enough to slice through skin flesh and muscle in one quick stroke I am no stranger to Valyrian steel But he had been hadn’t he Else he would never have been so foolish as to pick Littlefinger’s knife

The why of it still eluded him Simple cruelty perhaps His nephew had that in abundance It was all Tyrion could do not to retch up all the wine he’d drunk piss in his breeches or both He squirmed uncomfortably He ought to have held his tongue at breakfast The boy knows I know now My big mouth will be the death of me I swear it

The seven vows were made the seven blessings invoked and the seven promises exchanged When the wedding song had been sung and the challenge had gone unanswered it was time for the exchange of cloaks Tyrion shifted his weight from one stunted leg to the other trying to see between his father and his uncle Kevan If the gods are just Joff will make a hash of this He made certain not to look at Sansa lest his bitterness show in his eyes You might have knelt damn you Would it have been so bloody hard to bend those stiff Stark knees of yours and let me keep a little dignity

Mace Tyrell removed his daughter’s maiden cloak tenderly while Joffrey accepted the folded bride’s cloak from his brother Tommen and shook it out with a flourish The boy king was as tall at thirteen as his bride was at sixteen he would not require a fool’s back to climb upon He draped Margaery in the crimson-and-gold and leaned close to fasten it at her throat And that easily she passed from her father’s protection to her husband’s But who will protect her from Joff Tyrion glanced at the Knight of Flowers standing with the other Kingsguard You had best keep your sword well honed Ser Loras

With this kiss I pledge my love Joffrey declared in ringing tones When Margaery echoed the words he pulled her close and kissed her long and deep Rainbow lights danced once more about the High Septon’s crown as he solemnly declared Joffrey of the Houses Baratheon and Lannister and Margaery of House Tyrell to be one flesh one heart one soul

Good that’s done with Now let’s get back to the bloody castle so I can have a piss

Ser Loras and Ser Meryn led the procession from the sept in their white scale armor and snowy cloaks Then came Prince Tommen scattering rose petals from a basket before the king and queen After the royal couple followed Queen Cersei and Lord Tyrell then the bride’s mother arm-in-arm with Lord Tywin The Queen of Thorns tottered after them with one hand on Ser Kevan Lannister’s arm and the other on her cane her twin guardsmen close behind her in case she fell Next came Ser Garlan Tyrell and his lady wife and finally it was their turn

My lady Tyrion offered Sansa his arm She took it dutifully but he could feel her stiffness as they walked up the aisle together She never once looked down at him

He heard them cheering outside even before he reached the doors The mob loved Margaery so much they were even willing to love Joffrey again She had belonged to Renly the handsome young prince who had loved them so well he had come back from beyond the grave to save them And the bounty of Highgarden had come with her flowing up the roseroad from the south The fools didn’t seem to remember that it had been Mace Tyrell who closed the roseroad to begin with and made the bloody famine

They stepped out into the crisp autumn air I feared we’d never escape Tyrion quipped

Sansa had no choice but to look at him then I… yes my lord As you say She looked sad It was such a beautiful ceremony though

As ours was not It was long I’ll say that much I need to return to the castle for a good piss Tyrion rubbed the stump of his nose Would that I’d contrived some mission to take me out of the city Littlefinger was the clever one

Joffrey and Margaery stood surrounded by Kingsguard atop the steps that fronted on the broad marble plaza Ser Addam and his gold cloaks held back the crowd while the statue of King Baelor the Blessed gazed down on them benevolently Tyrion had no choice but to queue up with the rest to offer congratulations He kissed Margaery’s fingers and wished her every happiness Thankfully there were others behind them waiting their turn so they did not need to linger long

Their litter had been sitting in the sun and it was very warm inside the curtains As they lurched into motion Tyrion reclined on an elbow while Sansa sat staring at her hands She is just as comely as the Tyrell girl Her hair was a rich autumn auburn her eyes a deep Tully blue Grief had given her a haunted vulnerable look if anything it had only made her more beautiful He wanted to reach her to break through the armor of her courtesy Was that what made him speak Or just the need to distract himself from the fullness in his bladder

I had been thinking that when the roads are safe again we might journey to Casterly Rock Far from Joffrey and my sister The more he thought about what Joff had done to Lives of Four Kings the more it troubled him There was a message there oh yes It would please me to show you the Golden Gallery and the Lion’s Mouth and the Hall of Heroes where Jaime and I played as boys You can hear thunder from below where the sea comes in…

She raised her head slowly He knew what she was seeing the swollen brutish brow the raw stump of his nose his crooked pink scar and mismatched eyes Her own eyes were big and blue and empty I shall go wherever my lord husband wishes

I had hoped it might please you my lady

It will please me to please my lord

His mouth tightened What a pathetic little man you are Did you think babbling about the Lion’s Mouth would make her smile When have you ever made a woman smile but with gold No it was a foolish notion Only a Lannister can love the Rock

Yes my lord As you wish

Tyrion could hear the commons shouting out King Joffrey’s name In three years that cruel boy will be a man ruling in his own right… and every dwarf with half his wits will be a long way from King’s Landing Oldtown perhaps Or even the Free Cities He had always had a yen to see the Titan of Braavos Perhaps that would please Sansa Gently he spoke of Braavos and met a wall of sullen courtesy as icy and unyielding as the Wall he had walked once in the north It made him weary Then and now

They passed the rest of the journey in silence After a while Tyrion found himself hoping that Sansa would say something anything the merest word but she never spoke When the litter halted in the castle yard he let one of the grooms help her down We will be expected at the feast an hour hence my lady I will join you shortly He walked off stiff-legged Across the yard he could hear Margaery’s breathless laugh as Joffrey swept her from the saddle The boy will be as tall and strong as Jaime one day he thought and I’ll still be a dwarf beneath his feet And one day he’s like to make me even shorter…

He found a privy and sighed gratefully as he relieved himself of the morning’s wine There were times when a piss felt near as good as a woman and this was one He wished he could relieve himself of his doubts and guilts half as easily
