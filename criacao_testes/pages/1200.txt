They found Lommy where they’d left him under the oak I yield he called out at once when he saw them He’d flung away his own spear and raised his hands splotchy green with old dye I yield Please

The man with the torch searched around under the trees Are you the last Baker boy said there was a girl

She ran off when she heard you coming Lommy said You made a lot of noise And Arya thought Run Weasel run as far as you can run and hide and never come back

Tell us where we can find that whoreson Dondarrion and there’ll be a hot meal in it for you

Who said Lommy blankly

I told you this lot don’t know no more than those cunts in the village Waste o’bloody time

One of the spearmen drifted over to Lommy Something wrong with your leg boy

It got hurt

Can you walk He sounded concerned

No said Lommy You got to carry me

Think so The man lifted his spear casually and drove the point through the boy’s soft throat Lommy never even had time to yield again He jerked once and that was all When the man pulled his spear loose blood sprayed out in a dark fountain Carry him he says he muttered chuckling





TYRION

They had warned him to dress warmly Tyrion Lannister took them at their word He was garbed in heavy quilted breeches and a woolen doublet and over it all he had thrown the shadowskin cloak he had acquired in the Mountains of the Moon The cloak was absurdly long made for a man twice his height When he was not ahorse the only way to wear the thing was to wrap it around him several times which made him look like a ball of striped fur

Even so he was glad he had listened The chill in the long dank vault went bone deep Timett had chosen to retreat back up to the cellar after a brief taste of the cold below They were somewhere under the hill of Rhaenys behind the Guildhall of the Alchemists The damp stone walls were splotchy with nitre and the only light came from the sealed iron-and-glass oil lamp that Hallyne the Pyromancer carried so gingerly

Gingerly indeed… and these would be the ginger jars Tyrion lifted one for inspection It was round and ruddy a fat clay grapefruit A little big for his hand but it would fit comfortably in the grip of a normal man he knew The pottery was thin so fragile that even he had been warned not to squeeze too tightly lest he crush it in his fist The clay felt roughened pebbled Hallyne told him that was intentional A smooth pot is more apt to slip from a man’s grasp

The wildfire oozed slowly toward the lip of the jar when Tyrion tilted it to peer inside The color would be a murky green he knew but the poor light made that impossible to confirm Thick he observed

That is from the cold my lord said Hallyne a pallid man with soft damp hands and an obsequious manner He was dressed in striped black-and-scarlet robes trimmed with sable but the fur looked more than a little patchy and moth-eaten As it warms the substance will flow more easily like lamp oil

The substance was the pyromancers’ own term for wildfire They called each other wisdom as well which Tyrion found almost as annoying as their custom of hinting at the vast secret stores of knowledge that they wanted him to think they possessed Once theirs had been a powerful guild but in recent centuries the maesters of the Citadel had supplanted the alchemists almost everywhere Now only a few of the older order remained and they no longer even pretended to transmute metals…

…but they could make wildfire Water will not quench it I am told

That is so Once it takes fire the substance will burn fiercely until it is no more More it will seep into cloth wood leather even steel so they take fire as well

Tyrion remembered the red priest Thoros of Myr and his flaming sword Even a thin coating of wildfire could burn for an hour Thoros always needed a new sword after a melee but Robert had been fond of the man and ever glad to provide one Why doesn’t it seep into the clay as well

Oh but it does said Hallyne There is a vault below this one where we store the older pots Those from King Aerys’s day It was his fancy to have the jars made in the shapes of fruits Very perilous fruits indeed my lord Hand and hmmm riper now than ever if you take my meaning We have sealed them with wax and pumped the lower vault full of water but even so… by rights they ought to have been destroyed but so many of our masters were murdered during the Sack of King’s Landing the few acolytes who remained were unequal to the task And much of the stock we made for Aerys was lost Only last year two hundred jars were discovered in a storeroom beneath the Great Sept of Baelor No one could recall how they came there but I’m sure I do not need to tell you that the High Septon was beside himself with terror I myself saw that they were safely moved I had a cart filled with sand and sent our most able acolytes We worked only by night we—

—did a splendid job I have no doubt Tyrion placed the jar he’d been holding back among its fellows They covered the table standing in orderly rows of four and marching away into the subterranean dimness And there were other tables beyond many other tables These ah fruits of the late King Aerys can they still be used

Oh yes most certainly… but carefully my lord ever so carefully As it ages the substance grows ever more hmmmm fickle let us say Any flame will set it afire Any spark Too much heat and jars will blaze up of their own accord It is not wise to let them sit in sunlight even for a short time Once the fire begins within the heat causes the substance to expand violently and the jars shortly fly to pieces If other jars should happen to be stored in the same vicinity those go up as well and so—

How many jars do you have at present

This morning the Wisdom Munciter told me that we had seven thousand eight hundred and forty That count includes four thousand jars from King Aerys’s day to be sure

Our overripe fruits

Hallyne bobbed his head Wisdom Malliard believes we shall be able to provide a full ten thousand jars as was promised the queen I concur The pyromancer looked indecently pleased with that prospect

Assuming our enemies give you the time The pyromancers kept their recipe for wildfire a closely guarded secret but Tyrion knew that it was a lengthy dangerous and time-consuming process He had assumed the promise of ten thousand jars was a wild boast like that of the bannerman who vows to marshal ten thousand swords for his lord and shows up on the day of battle with a hundred and two If they can truly give us ten thousand…

He did not know whether he ought to be delighted or terrified Perhaps a smidge of both I trust that your guild brothers are not engaging in any unseemly haste Wisdom We do not want ten thousand jars of defective wildfire nor even one… and we most certainly do not want any mishaps

There will be no mishaps my lord Hand The substance is prepared by trained acolytes in a series of bare stone cells and each jar is removed by an apprentice and carried down here the instant it is ready Above each work cell is a room filled entirely with sand A protective spell has been laid on the floors hmmm most powerful Any fire in the cell below causes the floors to fall away and the sand smothers the blaze at once

Not to mention the careless acolyte By spell Tyrion imagined Hallyne meant clever trick He thought he would like to inspect one of these false-ceilinged cells to see how it worked but this was not the time Perhaps when the war was won

My brethren are never careless Hallyne insisted If I may be hmmmm frank…

Oh do

The substance flows through my veins and lives in the heart of every pyromancer We respect its power But the common soldier hmmmm the crew of one of the queen’s spitfires say in the unthinking frenzy of battle… any little mistake can bring catastrophe That cannot be said too often My father often told King Aerys as much as his father told old King Jaehaerys

They must have listened Tyrion said If they had burned the city down someone would have told me So your counsel is that we had best be careful 

Be very careful said Hallyne Be very very careful

These clay jars… do you have an ample supply

We do my lord and thank you for asking

You won’t mind if I take some then A few thousand

A few thousand

Or however many your guild can spare without interfering with production It’s empty pots I’m asking for understand Have them sent round to the captains on each of the city gates

I will my lord but why…

Tyrion smiled up at him When you tell me to dress warmly I dress warmly When you tell me to be careful well… He gave a shrug I’ve seen enough Perhaps you would be so good as to escort me back up to my litter

It would be my great hmmm pleasure my lord Hallyne lifted the lamp and led the way back to the stairs It was good of you to visit us A great honor hmmm It has been too long since the King’s Hand graced us with his presence Not since Lord Rossart and he was of our order That was back in King Aerys’s day King Aerys took a great interest in our work

King Aerys used you to roast the flesh off his enemies His brother Jaime had told him a few stories of the Mad King and his pet pyromancers Joffrey will be interested as well I have no doubt Which is why I’d best keep him well away from you

It is our great hope to have the king visit our Guildhall in his own royal person I have spoken of it to your royal sister A great feast…

It was growing warmer as they climbed His Grace has prohibited all feasting until such time as the war is won At my insistence The king does not think it fitting to banquet on choice food while his people go without bread
