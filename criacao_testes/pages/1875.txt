logical
unit rather than a physical acoustic one
and is defined in relation to a particular language by reference
to its use in discriminating different words
Classifications of sounds which are based on their
semantic
role as word-discriminators are called
ul
phonological
classifications  we could ensure that there is no ambiguity in the sense
with which we use the term phoneme by calling it a phonological unit and
the phonemic transcription could be called a phonological one
rh Broad phonetic transcription
A phoneme is an abstract unit representing a set of different sounds
The issue is confused by the fact that the members of the set actually
sound very similar if not identical to the untrained ear em precisely because
the difference between them plays no part in distinguishing words from
each other in the particular language concerned
pp
Take the words key and caw for example  Despite the difference in
spelling both of them begin with a
ul
k
sound that belongs in English
to the same phoneme set called
ul
k
However say them two or three times each concentrating on the position of
the tongue during the
ul
k
It is quite different in each case  For key it
is raised close to the roof of the mouth in preparation for the
ul
ee
whereas in caw it is much lower down
The sound of the
ul
k
is actually quite different in the two cases
Yet they belong to the same phoneme for there is no pair of words which
relies on this difference to distinguish them em key and caw are
obviously distinguished by their vowels not by the initial
consonant
You probably cannot hear clearly the difference between the two
ul
kc
s
precisely because they belong to the same phoneme and so the difference
is not important for English
pp
The point is sharpened by considering another language where we make a
distinction em and hence can hear the difference em between two sounds
that belong in the language to the same phoneme
Japanese does not distinguish
ul
r
from
ul
l
Japanese people
ul
do not hear
the difference between lice and rice in the same way that you do
not hear the difference between the two
ul
kc
s above
Cockneys do not hear except with a special effort the difference
between has and as or haitch and aitch for the Cockney dialect
does not recognize initial
ul
hc
s
pp
So what is a phoneme  It is a set of sounds whose members do not
discriminate between any words in the language under consideration
If you are mathematically minded you could think of it as an equivalence
class of sounds determined by the relationship
LB
sound sub 1 is related to sound sub 2 if sound sub 1 and sound sub 2
do not discriminate any pair of words in the language
LE
The
ul
p
and
ul
d
in
pig and dig belong to different phonemes in English
because they discriminate
the two words
ul
b
ul
f
and
ul
j
