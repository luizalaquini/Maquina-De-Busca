Listen She put a hand on his shoulder and he trembled at the sudden touch She’s warm Something comes Brienne lifted her sword to point off to his left There

He peered into the gloom until he saw it too Something was moving through the darkness he could not quite make it out…

A man on a horse No two Two riders side by side

Down here beneath the Rock It made no sense Yet there came two riders on pale horses men and mounts both armored The destriers emerged from the blackness at a slow walk They make no sound Jaime realized No splashing no clink of mail nor clop of hoof He remembered Eddard Stark riding the length of Aerys’s throne room wrapped in silence Only his eyes had spoken a lord’s eyes cold and grey and full of judgment

Is it you Stark Jaime called Come ahead I never feared you living I do not fear you dead

Brienne touched his arm There are more

He saw them too They were armored all in snow it seemed to him and ribbons of mist swirled back from their shoulders The visors of their helms were closed but Jaime Lannister did not need to look upon their faces to know them

Five had been his brothers Oswell Whent and Jon Darry Lewyn Martell a prince of Dorne The White Bull Gerold Hightower Ser Arthur Dayne Sword of the Morning And beside them crowned in mist and grief with his long hair streaming behind him rode Rhaegar Targaryen Prince of Dragonstone and rightful heir to the Iron Throne

You don’t frighten me he called turning as they split to either side of him He did not know which way to face I will fight you one by one or all together But who is there for the wench to duel She gets cross when you leave her out

I swore an oath to keep him safe she said to Rhaegar’s shade I swore a holy oath

We all swore oaths said Ser Arthur Dayne so sadly

The shades dismounted from their ghostly horses When they drew their longswords it made not a sound He was going to burn the city Jaime said To leave Robert only ashes

He was your king said Darry

You swore to keep him safe said Whent

And the children them as well said Prince Lewyn

Prince Rhaegar burned with a cold light now white now red now dark I left my wife and children in your hands

I never thought he’d hurt them Jaime’s sword was burning less brightly now I was with the king…

Killing the king said Ser Arthur

Cutting his throat said Prince Lewyn

The king you had sworn to die for said the White Bull

The fires that ran along the blade were guttering out and Jaime remembered what Cersei had said No Terror closed a hand about his throat Then his sword went dark and only Brienne’s burned as the ghosts came rushing in

No he said no no no Nooooooooo

Heart pounding he jerked awake and found himself in starry darkness amidst a grove of trees He could taste bile in his mouth and he was shivering with sweat hot and cold at once When he looked down for his sword hand his wrist ended in leather and linen wrapped snug around an ugly stump He felt sudden tears well up in his eyes I felt it I felt the strength in my fingers and the rough leather of the sword’s grip My hand…

My lord Qyburn knelt beside him his fatherly face all crinkly with concern What is it I heard you cry out

Steelshanks Walton stood above them tall and dour What is it Why did you scream

A dream… only a dream Jaime stared at the camp around him lost for a moment I was in the dark but I had my hand back He looked at the stump and felt sick all over again There’s no place like that beneath the Rock he thought His stomach was sour and empty and his head was pounding where he’d pillowed it against the stump

Qyburn felt his brow You still have a touch of fever

A fever dream Jaime reached up Help me Steelshanks took him by his good hand and pulled him to his feet

Another cup of dreamwine asked Qyburn

No I’ve dreamt enough this night He wondered how long it was till dawn Somehow he knew that if he closed his eyes he would be back in that dark wet place again

Milk of the poppy then And something for your fever You are still weak my lord You need to sleep To rest

That is the last thing I mean to do The moonlight glimmered pale upon the stump where Jaime had rested his head The moss covered it so thickly he had not noticed before but now he saw that the wood was white It made him think of Winterfell and Ned Stark’s heart tree It was not him he thought It was never him But the stump was dead and so was Stark and so were all the others Prince Rhaegar and Ser Arthur and the children And Aerys Aerys is most dead of all Do you believe in ghosts Maester he asked Qyburn

The man’s face grew strange Once at the Citadel I came into an empty room and saw an empty chair Yet I knew a woman had been there only a moment before The cushion was dented where she’d sat the cloth was still warm and her scent lingered in the air If we leave our smells behind us when we leave a room surely something of our souls must remain when we leave this life Qyburn spread his hands The archmaesters did not like my thinking though Well Marwyn did but he was the only one

Jaime ran his fingers through his hair Walton he said saddle the horses I want to go back

Back Steelshanks regarded him dubiously

He thinks I’ve gone mad And perhaps I have I left something at Harrenhal

Lord Vargo holds it now Him and his Bloody Mummers

You have twice the men he does

If I don’t serve you up to your father as commanded Lord Bolton will have my hide We press on to King’s Landing

Once Jaime might have countered with a smile and a threat but onehanded cripples do not inspire much fear He wondered what his brother would do Tyrion would find a way Lannisters lie Steelshanks Didn’t Lord Bolton tell you that

The man frowned suspiciously What if he did

Unless you take me back to Harrenhal the song I sing my father may not be one the Lord of the Dreadfort would wish to hear I might even say it was Bolton ordered my hand cut off and Steelshanks Walton who swung the blade

Walton gaped at him That isn’t so

No but who will my father believe Jaime made himself smile the way he used to smile when nothing in the world could frighten him It will be so much easier if we just go back We’d be on our way again soon enough and I’d sing such a sweet song in King’s Landing you’ll never believe your ears You’d get the girl and a nice fat purse of gold as thanks

Gold Walton liked that well enough How much gold

I have him Why how much would you want

And by the time the sun came up they were halfway back to Harrenhal

Jaime pushed his horse much harder than he had the day before and Steelshanks and the northmen were forced to match his pace Even so it was midday before they reached the castle on the lake Beneath a darkening sky that threatened rain the immense walls and five great towers stood black and ominous It looks so dead The walls were empty the gates closed and barred But high above the barbican a single banner hung limp The black goat of Qohor he knew Jaime cupped his hands to shout You in there Open your gates or I’ll kick them down

It was not until Qyburn and Steelshanks added their voices that a head finally appeared on the battlements above them He goggled down at them then vanished A short time later they heard the portcullis being drawn upward The gates swung open and Jaime Lannister spurred his horse through the walls scarcely glancing at the murder holes as he passed beneath them He had been worried that the goat might not admit them but it seemed as if the Brave Companions still thought of them as allies Fools

The outer ward was deserted only the long slate-roofed stables showed any signs of life and it was not horses that interested Jaime just then He reined up and looked about He could hear sounds from somewhere behind the Tower of Ghosts and men shouting in half a dozen tongues Steelshanks and Qyburn rode up on either side Get what you came back for and we’ll be gone again said Walton I want no trouble with the Mummers
