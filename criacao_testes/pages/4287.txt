of constant signal-to-noise ratio within a useful range of signal amplitudes
Figure 36 shows the logarithmic relation with one widely-used approximation to it
called the A-law
FC Figure 36
The idea of non-linearly quantizing a signal to achieve adequate signal-to-noise
ratios for a wide variety of amplitudes is called companding a contraction
of compressing-expanding  The original signal can be retrieved from
its A-law compression by antilogarithmic expansion

Figure 36 also
shows one common coding scheme which is a piecewise linear approximation
to the A-law  This provides an 8-bit code and gives the equivalent
of 12-bit linear quantization for small signal levels  It approximates
the A-law in 16 linear segments 8 for positive and 8 for negative
inputs
Consider the positive part of the curve  The first two segments which
are actually collinear correspond exactly to 12-bit linear conversion
Thus the output codes 0 to 31 correspond to inputs from 0 to 312048
in equal steps  Remember that both positive and negative signals
must be converted so a 12-bit linear converter will allocate 2048 levels
for positive signals and 2048 for negative ones  The next
segment provides 11-bit linear quantization
output codes 32 to 47 corresponding to inputs from 161024 to 311024
Similarly the next segment corresponds to 10-bit quantization covering
inputs from 16512 to 31512  And so on the last section giving 6-bit
quantization of inputs from 1632 to 3132 the full-scale positive value
Negative inputs are converted similarly
For signal levels of less than 322048 that is 2 sup -8 this implementation
of the A-law provides full 12-bit precision
As the signal level increases the precision decreases gradually to 6 bits
at maximum amplitudes

Logarithmic encoding provides what is in effect a floating-point representation
of the input  The conventional floating-point format however is not used
because many different codes can represent the same value  For example with
a 4-bit exponent preceding a 4-bit mantissa the words 00001000
00010100 00100010 and 00110001 represent the numbers
01  times  2 sup 0  001  times  2 sup 1
  0001  times  2 sup 2  c
and  00001  times  2 sup 3  respectively
which are the same  Some floating-point conventions assume that an unwritten
1 bit precedes the mantissa except when the whole word is zero but this
gives decreased resolution around zero em which is exactly where we want the
resolution to be greatest  Table 31 shows the 8-bit A-law codes

Logarithmic encoders and decoders are available from many semiconductor
manufacturers as single-chip devices
called codecs for coderdecoder  Intended for use on digital communication
links these generally provide a serial output bit-stream which
should be converted to parallel by a shift register if the data is intended
for a computer
Because of the potentially vast market for codecs in telecommunications
they are made in great quantities and are consequently very cheap
