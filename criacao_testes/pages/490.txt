This time she knew better than to say that she’d sooner work in the stables Yes your lord I mean my lord

The lord waved a hand Make her presentable he said to no one in particular and make certain she knows how to pour wine without spilling it Turning away he lifted a hand and said Lord Hoat see to those banners above the gatehouse

Four Brave Companions climbed to the ramparts and hauled down the lion of Lannister and Ser Amory’s own black manticore In their place they raised the flayed man of the Dreadfort and the direwolf of Stark And that evening a page named Nan poured wine for Roose Bolton and Vargo Hoat as they stood on the gallery watching the Brave Companions parade Ser Amory Lorch naked through the middle ward Ser Amory pleaded and sobbed and clung to the legs of his captors until Rorge pulled him loose and Shagwell kicked him down into the bear pit

The bear is all in black Arya thought Like Yoren She filled Roose Bolton’s cup and did not spill a drop





DAENERYS

In this city of splendors Dany had expected the House of the Undying Ones to be the most splendid of all but she emerged from her palanquin to behold a grey and ancient ruin

Long and low without towers or windows it coiled like a stone serpent through a grove of black-barked trees whose inky blue leaves made the stuff of the sorcerous drink the Qartheen called shade of the evening No other buildings stood near Black tiles covered the palace roof many fallen or broken the mortar between the stones was dry and crumbling She understood now why Xaro Xhoan Daxos called it the Palace of Dust Even Drogon seemed disquieted by the sight of it The black dragon hissed smoke seeping out between his sharp teeth

Blood of my blood Jhogo said in Dothraki this is an evil place a haunt of ghosts and maegi See how it drinks the morning sun Let us go before it drinks us as well

Ser Jorah Mormont came up beside them What power can they have if they live in that

Heed the wisdom of those who love you best said Xaro Xhoan Daxos lounging inside the palanquin Warlocks are bitter creatures who eat dust and drink of shadows They will give you naught They have naught to give

Aggo put a hand on his arakh Khaleesi it is said that many go into the Palace of Dust but few come out

It is said Jhogo agreed

We are blood of your blood said Aggo sworn to live and die as you do Let us walk with you in this dark place to keep you safe from harm

Some places even a khal must walk alone Dany said

Take me then Ser Jorah urged The risk—

Queen Daenerys must enter alone or not at all The warlock Pyat Pree stepped out from under the trees Has he been there all along Dany wondered Should she turn away now the doors of wisdom shall be closed to her forevermore

My pleasure barge awaits even now Xaro Xhoan Daxos called out Turn away from this folly most stubborn of queens I have flutists who will soothe your troubled soul with sweet music and a small girl whose tongue will make you sigh and melt

Ser Jorah Mormont gave the merchant prince a sour look Your Grace remember Mirri Maz Duur

I do Dany said suddenly decided I remember that she had knowledge And she was only a maegi

Pyat Pree smiled thinly The child speaks as sagely as a crone Take my arm and let me lead you

I am no child Dany took his arm nonetheless

It was darker than she would have thought under the black trees and the way was longer Though the path seemed to run straight from the street to the door of the palace Pyat Pree soon turned aside When she questioned him the warlock said only The front way leads in but never out again Heed my words my queen The House of the Undying Ones was not made for mortal men If you value your soul take care and do just as I tell you

I will do as you say Dany promised

When you enter you will find yourself in a room with four doors the one you have come through and three others Take the door to your right Each time the door to your right If you should come upon a stairwell climb Never go down and never take any door but the first door to your right

The door to my right Dany repeated I understand And when I leave the opposite
