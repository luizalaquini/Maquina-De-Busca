The Others can bugger each other with the septon’s crown for all I care

When you named me to command the Watch you told me you wanted plain truth always

Somehow I have a feeling I am not going to like whatever you’re about to say Tyrion said gloomily

We held the city today my lord but I make no promises for the morrow The kettle is close to boiling So many thieves and murderers are abroad that no man’s house is safe the bloody flux is spreading in the stews along Pisswater Bend there’s no food to be had for copper nor silver Where before you heard only mutterings from the gutter now there’s open talk of treason in guildhalls and markets

Do you need more men

I do not trust half the men I have now Slynt tripled the size of the Watch but it takes more than a gold cloak to make a watchman There are good men and loyal among the new recruits but also more brutes sots cravens and traitors than you’d care to know They’re half-trained and undisciplined and what loyalty they have is to their own skins If it comes to battle they’ll not hold I fear

I never expected them to said Tyrion Once our walls are breeched we are lost I’ve known that from the start

My men are largely drawn from the smallfolk They walk the same streets drink in the same winesinks spoon down their bowls of brown in the same pot-shops Your eunuch must have told you there is small love for the Lannisters in King’s Landing Many still remember how your lord father sacked the city when Aerys opened the gates to him They whisper that the gods are punishing us for the sins of your House—for your brother’s murder of King Aerys for the butchery of Rhaegar’s children for the execution of Eddard Stark and the savagery of Joffrey’s justice Some talk openly of how much better things were when Robert was king and hint that times would be better again with Stannis on the throne In pot-shops and winesinks and brothels you hear these things—and in the barracks and guardhalls as well I fear

They hate my family is that what you are telling me

Aye    and will turn on them if the chance comes

Me as well

Ask your eunuch

I’m asking you

Bywater’s deep-set eyes met the dwarf’s mismatched ones and did not blink You most of all my lord

Most of all The injustice was like to choke him It was Joffrey who told them to eat their dead Joffrey who set his dog on them How could they blame me

His Grace is but a boy In the streets it is said that he has evil councillors The queen has never been known as a friend to the commons nor is Lord Varys called the Spider out of love    but it is you they blame most Your sister and the eunuch were here when times were better under King Robert but you were not They say that you’ve filled the city with swaggering sellswords and unwashed savages brutes who take what they want and follow no laws but their own They say you exiled Janos Slynt because you found him too bluff and honest for your liking They say you threw wise and gentle Pycelle into the dungeons when he dared raise his voice against you Some even claim that you mean to seize the Iron Throne for your own

Yes and I am a monster besides hideous and misshapen never forget that His hand coiled into a fist I’ve heard enough We both have work to attend to Leave me

Perhaps my lord father was right to despise me all these years if this is the best I can achieve Tyrion thought when he was alone He stared down at the remains of his supper his belly roiling at the sight of the cold greasy capon Disgusted he pushed it away shouted for Pod and sent the boy running to summon Varys and Bronn My most trusted advisers are a eunuch and a sellsword and my lady’s a whore What does that say of me

Bronn complained of the gloom when he arrived and insisted on a fire in the hearth It was blazing by the time Varys made his appearance Where have you been Tyrion demanded

About the king’s business my sweet lord

Ah yes the king Tyrion muttered My nephew is not fit to sit a privy let alone the Iron Throne

Varys shrugged An apprentice must be taught his trade

Half the ’prentices on Reeking Lane could rule better than this king of yours Bronn seated himself across the table and pulled a wing off the capon

Tyrion had made a practice of ignoring the sellsword’s frequent insolences but tonight he found it galling I don’t recall giving you leave to finish my supper

You didn’t look to be eating it Bronn said through a mouthful of meat City’s starving it’s a crime to waste food You have any wine

Next he’ll want me to pour it for him Tyrion thought darkly You go too far he warned

And you never go far enough Bronn tossed the wingbone to the rushes Ever think how easy life would be if the other one had been born first He thrust his fingers inside the capon and tore off a handful of breast The weepy one Tommen Seems like he’d do whatever he was told as a good king should

A chill crept down Tyrion’s spine as he realized what the sellsword was hinting at If Tommen was king   

There was only one way Tommen would become king No he could not even think it Joffrey was his own blood and Jaime’s son as much as Cersei’s I could have your head off for saying that he told Bronn but the sellsword only laughed

Friends said Varys quarreling will not serve us I beg you both take heart

Whose asked Tyrion sourly He could think of several tempting choices





DAVOS

Ser Cortnay Penrose wore no armor He sat a sorrel stallion his standard-bearer a dapple grey Above them flapped Baratheon’s crowned stag and the crossed quills of Penrose white on a russet field Ser Cortnay’s spade-shaped beard was russet as well though he’d gone wholly bald on top If the size and splendor of the king’s party impressed him it did not show on that weathered face

They trotted up with much clinking of chain and rattle of plate Even Davos wore mail though he could not have said why his shoulders and lower back ached from the unaccustomed weight It made him feel cumbered and foolish and he wondered once more why he was here It is not for me to question the king’s commands and yet   

Every man of the party was of better birth and higher station than Davos Seaworth and the great lords glittered in the morning sun Silvered steel and gold inlay brightened their armor and their warhelms were crested in a riot of silken plumes feathers and cunningly wrought heraldic beasts with gemstone eyes Stannis himself looked out of place in this rich and royal company Like Davos the king was plainly garbed in wool and boiled leather though the circlet of red gold about his temples lent him a certain grandeur Sunlight flashed off its flame-shaped points whenever he moved his head

This was the closest Davos had come to His Grace in the eight days since Black Betha had joined the rest of the fleet off Storm’s End He’d sought an audience within an hour of his arrival only to be told that the king was occupied The king was often occupied Davos learned from his son Devan one of the royal squires Now that Stannis Baratheon had come into his power the lordlings buzzed around him like flies round a corpse He looks half a corpse too years older than when I left Dragonstone Devan said the king scarcely slept of late Since Lord Renly died he has been troubled by terrible nightmares the boy had confided to his father Maester’s potions do not touch them Only the Lady Melisandre can soothe him to sleep

Is that why she shares his pavilion now Davos wondered To pray with him Or does she have another way to soothe him to sleep It was an unworthy question and one he dared not ask even of his own son Devan was a good boy but he wore the flaming heart proudly on his doublet and his father had seen him at the nightfires as dusk fell beseeching the Lord of Light to bring the dawn He is the king’s squire he told himself it is only to be expected that he would take the king’s god

Davos had almost forgotten how high and thick the walls of Storm’s End loomed up close King Stannis halted beneath them a few feet from Ser Cortnay and his standard-bearer Ser he said with stiff courtesy He made no move to dismount

My lord That was less courteous but not unexpected

It is customary to grant a king the style Your Grace announced Lord Florent A red gold fox poked its shining snout out from his breastplate through a circle of lapis lazuli flowers Very tall very courtly and very rich the Lord of Brightwater Keep had been the first of Renly’s bannermen to declare for Stannis and the first to renounce his old gods and take up the Lord of Light Stannis had left his queen on Dragonstone along with her uncle Axell but the queen’s men were more numerous and powerful than ever and Alester Florent was the foremost

Ser Cortnay Penrose ignored him preferring to address Stannis This is a notable company The great lords Estermont Errol and Varner Ser Jon of the green-apple Fossoways and Ser Bryan of the red Lord Caron and Ser Guyard of King Renly’s Rainbow Guard    and the puissant Lord Alester Florent of Brightwater to be sure Is that your Onion Knight I spy to the rear Well met Ser Davos I fear I do not know the lady

I am named Melisandre ser She alone came unarmored but for her flowing red robes At her throat the great ruby drank the daylight I serve your king and the Lord of Light

I wish you well of them my lady Ser Cortnay answered but I bow to other gods and a different king

There is but one true king and one true god announced Lord Florent

Are we here to dispute theology my lord Had I known I would have brought a septon

You know full well why we are here said Stannis You have had a fortnight to consider my offer You sent your ravens No help has come Nor will it Storm’s End stands alone and I am out of patience One last time ser I command you to open your gates and deliver me that which is mine by rights

And the terms asked Ser Cortnay

Remain as before said Stannis I will pardon you for your treason as I have pardoned these lords you see behind me The men of your garrison will be free to enter my service or to return unmolested to their homes You may keep your weapons and as much property as a man can carry I will require your horses and pack animals however
