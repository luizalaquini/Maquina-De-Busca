I never win anything Dolorous Edd complained The gods always smiled on Watt though When the wildlings knocked him off the Bridge of Skulls somehow he landed in a nice deep pool of water How lucky was that missing all those rocks

Was it a long fall Grenn wanted to know Did landing in the pool of water save his life

No said Dolorous Edd He was dead already from that axe in his head Still it was pretty lucky missing the rocks

Three-Finger Hobb had promised the brothers roast haunch of mammoth that night maybe in hopes of cadging a few more votes If that was his notion he should have found a younger mammoth Sam thought as he pulled a string of gristle out from between his teeth Sighing he pushed the food away

There would be another vote shortly and the tensions in the air were thicker than the smoke Cotter Pyke sat by the fire surrounded by rangers from Eastwatch Ser Denys Mallister was near the door with a smaller group of Shadow Tower men Janos Slynt has the best place Sam realized halfway between the flames and the drafts He was alarmed to see Bowen Marsh beside him wan-faced and haggard his head still wrapped in linen but listening to all that Lord Janos had to say When he pointed that out to his friends Pyp said And look down there that’s Ser Alliser whispering with Othell Yarwyck

After the meal Maester Aemon rose to ask if any of the brothers wished to speak before they cast their tokens Dolorous Edd got up stone-faced and glum as ever I just want to say to whoever is voting for me that I would certainly make an awful Lord Commander But so would all these others He was followed by Bowen Marsh who stood with one hand on Lord Slynt’s shoulder Brothers and friends I am asking that my name be withdrawn from this choosing My wound still troubles me and the task is too large for me I fear… but not for Lord Janos here who commanded the gold cloaks of King’s Landing for many years Let us all give him our support

Sam heard angry mutters from Cotter Pyke’s end of the room and Ser Denys looked at one of his companions and shook his head It is too late the damage is done He wondered where Jon was and why he had stayed away

Most of the brothers were unlettered so by tradition the choosing was done by dropping tokens into a big potbellied iron kettle that Three-Finger Hobb and Owen the Oaf had dragged over from the kitchens The barrels of tokens were off in a corner behind a heavy drape so the voters could make their choice unseen You were allowed to have a friend cast your token if you had duty so some men took two tokens three or four and Ser Denys and Cotter Pyke voted for the garrisons they had left behind

When the hall was finally empty save for them Sam and Clydas upended the kettle in front of Maester Aemon A cascade of seashells stones and copper pennies covered the table Aemon’s wrinkled hands sorted with surprising speed moving the shells here the stones there the pennies to one side the occasional arrowhead nail and acorn off to themselves Sam and Clydas counted the piles each of them keeping his own tally

Tonight it was Sam’s turn to give his results first Two hundred and three for Ser Denys Mallister he said One hundred and sixty-nine for Cotter Pyke One hundred and thirty-seven for Lord Janos Slynt seventy-two for Othell Yarwyck five for Three-Finger Hobb and two for Dolorous Edd

I had one hundred and sixty-eight for Pyke Clydas said We are two votes short by my count and one by Sam’s

Sam’s count is correct said Maester Aemon Jon Snow did not cast a token It makes no matter No one is close

Sam was more relieved than disappointed Even with Bowen Marsh’s support Lord Janos was still only third Who are these five who keep voting for Three-Finger Hobb he wondered

Brothers who want him out of the kitchens said Clydas

Ser Denys is down ten votes since yesterday Sam pointed out And Cotter Pyke is down almost twenty That’s not good

Not good for their hopes of becoming Lord Commander certainly said Maester Aemon Yet it may be good for the Night’s Watch in the end That is not for us to say Ten days is not unduly long There was once a choosing that lasted near two years some seven hundred votes The brothers will come to a decision in their own time

Yes Sam thought but what decision

Later over cups of watered wine in the privacy of Pyp’s cell Sam’s tongue loosened and he found himself thinking aloud Cotter Pyke and Ser Denys Mallister have been losing ground but between them they still have almost two-thirds he told Pyp and Grenn Either one would be fine as Lord Commander Someone needs to convince one of them to withdraw and support the other

Someone said Grenn doubtfully What someone

Grenn is so dumb he thinks someone might be him said Pyp Maybe when someone is done with Pyke and Mallister he should convince King Stannis to marry Queen Cersei too

King Stannis is married Grenn objected

What am I going to do with him Sam sighed Pyp

Cotter Pyke and Ser Denys don’t like each other much Grenn argued stubbornly They fight about everything

Yes but only because they have different ideas about what’s best for the Watch said Sam If we explained—

We said Pyp How did someone change to we I’m the mummer’s monkey remember And Grenn is well Grenn He smiled at Sam and wiggled his ears You now… you’re a lord’s son and the maester’s steward…

And Sam the Slayer said Grenn You slew an Other

It was the dragonglass that killed it Sam told him for the hundredth time

A lord’s son the maester’s steward and Sam the Slayer Pyp mused You could talk to them might be…

I could said Sam sounding as gloomy as Dolorous Edd if I wasn’t too craven to face them





Jon


Jon prowled around Satin in a slow circle sword in hand forcing him to turn Get your shield up he said

It’s too heavy the Oldtown boy complained

It’s as heavy as it needs to be to stop a sword Jon said Now get it up He stepped forward slashing Satin jerked the shield up in time to catch the sword on its rim and swung his own blade at Jon’s ribs Good Jon said when he felt the impact on his own shield That was good But you need to put your body into it Get your weight behind the steel and you’ll do more damage than with arm strength alone Come try it again drive at me but keep the shield up or I’ll ring your head like a bell…

Instead Satin took a step backward and raised his visor Jon he said in an anxious voice

When he turned she was standing behind him with half a dozen queen’s men around her Small wonder the yard grew so quiet He had glimpsed Melisandre at her nightfires and coming and going about the castle but never so close She’s beautiful he thought… but there was something more than a little unsettling about red eyes My lady

The king would speak with you Jon Snow

Jon thrust the practice sword into the earth Might I be allowed to change I am in no fit state to stand before a king

We shall await you atop the Wall said Melisandre We Jon heard not he It’s as they say This is his true queen not the one he left at Eastwatch

He hung his mail and plate inside the armory returned to his own cell discarded his sweat-stained clothes and donned a fresh set of blacks It would be cold and windy in the cage he knew and colder and windier still on top of the ice so he chose a heavy hooded cloak Last of all he collected Longclaw and slung the bastard sword across his back

Melisandre was waiting for him at the base of the Wall She had sent her queen’s men away What does His Grace want of me Jon asked her as they entered the cage

All you have to give Jon Snow He is a king

He shut the door and pulled the bell cord The winch began to turn They rose The day was bright and the Wall was weeping long fingers of water trickling down its face and glinting in the sun In the close confines of the iron cage he was acutely aware of the red woman’s presence She even smells red The scent reminded him of Mikken’s forge of the way iron smelled when red-hot the scent was smoke and blood Kissed by fire he thought remembering Ygritte The wind got in amongst Melisandre’s long red robes and sent them flapping against Jon’s legs as he stood beside her You are not cold my lady he asked her

She laughed Never The ruby at her throat seemed to pulse in time with the beating of her heart The Lord’s fire lives within me Jon Snow Feel She put her hand on his cheek and held it there while he felt how warm she was That is how life should feel she told him Only death is cold

They found Stannis Baratheon standing alone at the edge of the Wall brooding over the field where he had won his battle and the great green forest beyond He was dressed in the same black breeches tunic and boots that a brother of the Night’s Watch might wear Only his cloak set him apart a heavy golden cloak trimmed in black fur and pinned with a brooch in the shape of a flaming heart I have brought you the Bastard of Winterfell Your Grace said Melisandre

Stannis turned to study him Beneath his heavy brow were eyes like bottomless blue pools His hollow cheeks and strong jaw were covered with a short-cropped blue-black beard that did little to conceal the gauntness of his face and his teeth were clenched His neck and shoulders were clenched as well and his right hand Jon found himself remembering something Donal Noye once said about the Baratheon brothers Robert was the true steel Stannis is pure iron black and hard and strong but brittle the way iron gets He’ll break before he bends Uneasily he knelt wondering why this brittle king had need of him

Rise I have heard much and more of you Lord Snow

I am no lord sire Jon rose I know what you have heard That I am a turncloak and craven That I slew my brother Qhorin Halfhand so the wildlings would spare my life That I rode with Mance Rayder and took a wildling wife

Aye All that and more You are a warg too they say a skinchanger who walks at night as a wolf King Stannis had a hard smile How much of it is true
