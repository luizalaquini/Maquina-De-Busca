our path Screaming people bleeding people dead people
everywhere As we reach the next corner the entire block
ahead of us lights up with a rich purple glow We
backpedal hunker down in a stairwell and squint into the
light Somethings happening to those illuminated by it
Theyre assaulted bywhat A sound A wave A laser
Weapons fall from their hands fingers clutch their faces as
blood sprays from all visible orifices--eyes noses mouths
ears In less than a minute everyones dead and the glow
vanishes I grit my teeth and run leaping over the bodies
feet slipping in the gore The wind whips the snow into
blinding swirls but doesnt block out the sound of another
wave of boots headed our way
Get down I hiss at Gale We drop where we are My
face lands in a still-warm pool of someones blood but I
play dead remain motionless as the boots march over us
Some avoid the bodies Others grind into my hand my
back kick my head in passing As the boots recede I open
my eyes and nod to Gale
On the next block we encounter more terrified
refugees but few soldiers Just when it seems we might
have caught a break theres a cracking sound like an egg
hitting the side of a bowl but magnified a thousand times
We stop look around for the pod Theres nothing Then I
feel the tips of my boots beginning to tilt ever so slightly
Run I cry to Gale Theres no time to explain but in a few
seconds the nature of the pod becomes clear to everyone
A seam has opened up down the center of the block The
two sides of the tiled street are folding down like flaps
slowly emptying the people into whatever lies beneath
Im torn between making a beeline for the next
intersection and trying to get to the doors that line the street
and break my way into a building As a result I end up
moving at a slight diagonal As the flap continues to drop I
find my feet scrambling harder and harder to find
purchase on the slippery tiles Its like running along the
side of an icy hill that gets steeper at every step Both of my
destinations--the intersection and the buildings--are a few
feet away when I feel the flap going Theres nothing to do
but use my last seconds of connection to the tiles to push
off for the intersection As my hands latch on to the side I
realize the flaps have swung straight down My feet dangle
in the air no foothold anywhere From fifty feet below a vile
stench hits my nose like rotted corpses in the summer
heat Black forms crawl around in the shadows silencing
whoever survives the fall
A strangled cry comes from my throat No one is
coming to help me Im losing my grip on the icy ledge
when I see Im only about six feet from the corner of the pod
I inch my hands along the ledge trying to block out the
terrifying sounds from below When my hands straddle the
corner I swing my right boot up over the side It catches on
something and I painstakingly drag myself up to street level
Panting trembling I crawl out and wrap my arm around a
lamppost for an anchor although the grounds perfectly flat
Gale I call into the abyss heedless of being
recognized Gale
Over here I look in bewilderment to my left The flap
held up everything to the very base of the buildings A
dozen or so people made it that far and now hang from
whatever provides a handhold Doorknobs knockers mail
slots Three doors down from me Gale clings to the
decorative iron grating around an apartment door He could
easily get inside if it was open But despite repeated kicks
to the door no one comes to his aid
Cover yourself I lift my gun He turns away and I drill
the lock until the door flies inward Gale swings into the
doorway landing in a heap on the floor For a moment I
experience the elation of his rescue Then the white-gloved
hands clamp down on him
Gale meets my eyes mouths something at me I cant
make out I dont know what to do I cant leave him but I
cant reach him either His lips move again I shake my
head to indicate my confusion At any minute theyll realize
who theyve captured The Peacekeepers are hauling him
inside now Go I hear him yell
I turn and run away from the pod All alone now Gale a
prisoner Cressida and Pollux could be dead ten times
over And Peeta I havent laid eyes on him since we left
Tigriss I hold on to the idea that he may have gone back
Felt an attack coming and retreated to the cellar while he
still had control Realized there was no need for a diversion
when the Capitol has provided so many No need to be bait
and have to take the nightlock--the nightlock Gale doesnt
have any And as for all that talk of detonating his arrows by
hand hell never get the chance The first thing the
Peacekeepers will do is to strip him of his weapons
I fall into a doorway tears stinging my eyes Shoot me
Thats what he was mouthing I was supposed to shoot him
That was my job That was our unspoken promise all of us
to one another And I didnt do it and now the Capitol will kill
him or torture him or hijack him or--the cracks begin
opening inside me threatening to break me into pieces I
have only one hope That the Capitol falls lays down its
arms and gives up its prisoners before they hurt Gale But I
cant see that happening while Snows alive
A pair of Peacekeepers runs by barely glancing at the
whimpering Capitol girl huddled in a doorway I choke down
my tears wipe the existing ones off my face before they
can freeze and pull myself back together Okay Im still an
