You fly Mord had promised him when he’d shoved him into the cell Twenty day thirty fifty maybe Then you fly

The Arryns kept the only dungeon in the realm where the prisoners were welcome to escape at will That first day after girding up his courage for hours Tyrion had lain flat on his stomach and squirmed to the edge to poke out his head and look down Sky was six hundred feet below with nothing between but empty air If he craned his neck out as far as it could go he could see other cells to his right and left and above him He was a bee in a stone honeycomb and someone had torn off his wings

It was cold in the cell the wind screamed night and day and worst of all the floor sloped Ever so slightly yet it was enough He was afraid to close his eyes afraid that he might roll over in his steep and wake in sudden terror as he went sliding off the edge Small wonder the sky cells drove men mad

Gods save me some previous tenant had written on the wall in something that looked suspiciously like blood the blue is calling At first Tyrion wondered who he’d been and what had become of him later he decided that he would rather not know

If only he had shut his mouth…

The wretched boy had started it looking down on him from a throne of carved weirwood beneath the moon-and-falcon banners of House Arryn Tyrion Lannister had been looked down on all his life but seldom by rheumy-eyed six-year-olds who needed to stuff fat cushions under their cheeks to lift them to the height of a man Is he the bad man the boy had asked clutching his doll

He is the Lady Lysa had said from the lesser throne beside him She was all in blue powdered and perfumed for the suitors who filled her court

He’s so small the Lord of the Eyrie said giggling

This is Tyrion the Imp of House Lannister who murdered your father She raised her voice so it carried down the length of High Hall of the Eyrie ringing off the milk-white walls and the slender pillars so every man could hear it He slew the Hand of the King

Oh did I kill him too Tyrion had said like a fool

That would have been a very good time to have kept his mouth closed and his head bowed He could see that now seven hells he had seen it then The High Hall of the Arryns was long and austere with a forbidding coldness to its walls of blue-veined white marble but the faces around him had been colder by far The power of Casterly Rock was far away and there were no friends of the Lannisters in the Vale of Arryn Submission and silence would have been his best defenses

But Tyrion’s mood had been too foul for sense To his shame he had faltered during the last leg of their day-long climb up to the Eyrie his stunted legs unable to take him any higher Bronn had carried him the rest of the way and the humiliation poured oil on the flames of his anger It would seem I’ve been a busy little fellow he said with bitter sarcasm I wonder when I found the time to do all this slaying and murdering

He ought to have remembered who he was dealing with Lysa Arryn and her half-sane weakling son had not been known at court for their love of wit especially when it was directed at them

Imp Lysa said coldly you will guard that mocking tongue of yours and speak to my son politely or I promise you will have cause to regret it Remember where you are This is the Eyrie and these are knights of the Vale you see around you true men who loved Jon Arryn well Every one of them would die for me

Lady Arryn should any harm come to me my brother Jaime will be pleased to see that they do Even as he spat out the words Tyrion knew they were folly

Can you fly my lord of Lannister Lady Lysa asked Does a dwarf have wings If not you would be wiser to swallow the next threat that comes to mind

I made no threats Tyrion said That was a promise

Little Lord Robert hopped to his feet at that so upset he dropped his doll You can’t hurt us he screamed No one can hurt us here Tell him Mother tell him he can’t hurt us here The boy began to twitch

The Eyrie is impregnable Lysa Arryn declared calmly She drew her son close holding him safe in the circle of her plump white arms The Imp is trying to frighten us sweet baby The Lannisters are all liars No one will hurt my sweet boy

The hell of it was she was no doubt right Having seen what it took to get here Tyrion could well imagine how it would be for a knight trying to fight his way up in armor while stones and arrows poured down from above and enemies contested with him for every step Nightmare did not begin to describe it Small wonder the Eyrie had never been taken

Still Tyrion had been unable to silence himself Not impregnable he said merely inconvenient

Young Robert pointed down his hand trembling You’re a liar Mother I want to see him fly Two guardsmen in sky-blue cloaks seized Tyrion by the arms lifting him off his floor

The gods only know what might have happened then were it not for Catelyn Stark Sister she called out from where she stood below the thrones I beg you to remember this man is my prisoner I will not have him harmed

Lysa Arryn glanced at her sister coolly for a moment then rose and swept down on Tyrion her long skirts trailing after her For an instant he feared she would strike him but instead she commanded them to release him Her men shoved him to the floor his legs went out from under him and Tyrion fell

He must have made quite a sight as he struggled to his knees only to feel his right leg spasm sending him sprawling once more Laughter boomed up and down the High Hall of the Arryns

My sister’s little guest is too weary to stand Lady Lysa announced Ser Vardis take him down to the dungeon A rest in one of our sky cells will do him much good

The guardsmen jerked him upright Tyrion Lannister dangled between them kicking feebly his face red with shame I will remember this he told them all as they carried him off
