They range from simple games and demonstrations through serious database
services to system maintenance facilities
A priority structure is imposed upon them with higher
service numbers being available only to higher priority users
Services in the lowest range 1-99 can be obtained by all while
those in the highest range 900-999 are maintenance services
available only to the system designers  Access to the lower-numbered
games services can be inhibited by a priority user em this was
found necessary to prevent over-use of the system  Another advantage
of telephone access to an information retrieval system is that some
day-to-day maintenance can be done remotely from the office telephone

This telephone enquiry service which was built in 1974 demonstrated that
speech synthesis had moved from a specialist phonetic discipline into the
province of engineering practicability  The speech was generated by rule
from a phonetic input the method is covered in Chapters 7 and 8 which
has very low data storage requirements of around 75 bits of speech
Thus an enormous vocabulary and range of services could be accomodated on a
small computer system
Despite the fairly low quality of the speech the response from callers was
most encouraging  Admittedly the user population was a self-selected body of
University staff which one might suppose to have high tolerance to new ideas
and a system designed for the general public would require more effort to be
spent on developing speech of greater intelligibility  Although it was
observed that some callers failed to understand parts of the responses even
after repetition communication was largely unhindered in most cases users
being driven by a high motivation to help the system help them

The use of speech output in conjunction with a simple input device requires
careful thought for interaction to be successful and comfortable  It is
necessary that the computer direct the conversation as much as possible
without seeming to be taking charge  Provision for eliminating prompts
which are unwanted by sophisticated users is essential to avoid frustration
We will return to the topic of programming techniques for speech interaction
in Chapter 10

Making a computer system available over the telephone results in a sudden
vast increase in the user population  Although peoples reaction to a new
computer terminal in every office was overwhelmingly favourable careful
resource allocation was essential to prevent the service being hogged by a
persistent few  As with all multi-access computer systems it is particularly
important that error recovery is effected automatically and gracefully

The telephone enquiry service was an experimental vehicle for research on speech
interaction and was developed in 1974
Since then speech has begun to be used in real commercial applications
One example is System X the British Post Offices computer-controlled
telephone exchange  This incorporates many features
not found in conventional telephone exchanges
For example if a number is found to be busy the call can be attempted
again by a repeat last call command without having to re-dial the full number
Alternatively the last number can be stored for future re-dialling freeing
the phone for other calls
Short code
dialling allows a customer to associate short codes with commonly-dialled
numbers
Alarm calls can be booked at specified times and are made automatically
without human intervention
Incoming calls can be barred as can outgoing ones  A diversion service
allows all incoming calls to be diverted to another telephone either
immediately or if a call to the original number remains unanswered for
a specified period of time or if the original number is busy
Three-party calls can be set up automatically without involving the
operator
pp
Making use of these facilities presents the caller with something of a problem
With conventional telephone exchanges feedback is provided on what is happening
to a call by the use of four tones em the dial tone the busy tone
the ringing tone and the number unavailable tone
For the more sophisticated interaction which is expected on the advanced
exchange a much greater variety of status signals is required
The obvious solution is to use
computer-generated spoken
messages to inform the caller when these services are invoked and to guide him
through the sequences of actions needed to set up facilities like call
re-direction  For example the messages used by the exchange when a user
accesses the alarm call
service are

Because of the rather small vocabulary the number of messages that can be
stored in their entirety rather than being formed by concatenation of
smaller units and the short time which was available for development
System X stores speech as a time waveform slightly compressed by a time-domain
encoding operation such techniques are described in Chapter 3
Utterances which contain variable parts like the time of alarm in the messages
above are formed by inserting separately-recorded digits in a fixed 
carrier message  No attempt is made to apply uniform intonation
