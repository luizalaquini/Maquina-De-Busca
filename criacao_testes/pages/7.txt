103 And the sons of Gomer Ashkenaz and Riphath and Togarmah

104 And the sons of Javan Elishah and Tarshish Kittim and
Dodanim

105 By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands
every one after his tongue after their families in their nations

106 And the sons of Ham Cush and Mizraim and Phut and Canaan

107 And the sons of Cush Seba and Havilah and Sabtah and Raamah
and Sabtechah and the sons of Raamah Sheba and Dedan

108 And Cush begat Nimrod he began to be a mighty one in the earth

109 He was a mighty hunter before the LORD wherefore it is said
Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD

1010 And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel and Erech and
Accad and Calneh in the land of Shinar

1011 Out of that land went forth Asshur and builded Nineveh and the
city Rehoboth and Calah 1012 And Resen between Nineveh and Calah
the same is a great city

1013 And Mizraim begat Ludim and Anamim and Lehabim and Naphtuhim
1014 And Pathrusim and Casluhim out of whom came Philistim and
Caphtorim

1015 And Canaan begat Sidon his first born and Heth 1016 And the
Jebusite and the Amorite and the Girgasite 1017 And the Hivite
and the Arkite and the Sinite 1018 And the Arvadite and the
Zemarite and the Hamathite and afterward were the families of the
Canaanites spread abroad

1019 And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon as thou comest
to Gerar unto Gaza as thou goest unto Sodom and Gomorrah and
Admah and Zeboim even unto Lasha

1020 These are the sons of Ham after their families after their
tongues in their countries and in their nations

1021 Unto Shem also the father of all the children of Eber the
brother of Japheth the elder even to him were children born

1022 The children of Shem Elam and Asshur and Arphaxad and Lud
and Aram

1023 And the children of Aram Uz and Hul and Gether and Mash

1024 And Arphaxad begat Salah and Salah begat Eber

1025 And unto Eber were born two sons the name of one was Peleg for
in his days was the earth divided and his brothers name was Joktan

1026 And Joktan begat Almodad and Sheleph and Hazarmaveth and
Jerah 1027 And Hadoram and Uzal and Diklah 1028 And Obal and
Abimael and Sheba 1029 And Ophir and Havilah and Jobab all these
were the sons of Joktan

1030 And their dwelling was from Mesha as thou goest unto Sephar a
mount of the east

1031 These are the sons of Shem after their families after their
tongues in their lands after their nations

1032 These are the families of the sons of Noah after their
generations in their nations and by these were the nations divided
in the earth after the flood

111 And the whole earth was of one language and of one speech

112 And it came to pass as they journeyed from the east that they
found a plain in the land of Shinar and they dwelt there

113 And they said one to another Go to let us make brick and burn
them thoroughly And they had brick for stone and slime had they for
morter

114 And they said Go to let us build us a city and a tower whose
top may reach unto heaven and let us make us a name lest we be
scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth

115 And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower which the
children of men builded

116 And the LORD said Behold the people is one and they have all
one language and this they begin to do and now nothing will be
restrained from them which they have imagined to do

117 Go to let us go down and there confound their language that
they may not understand one anothers speech

118 So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of
all the earth and they left off to build the city

119 Therefore is the name of it called Babel because the LORD did
there confound the language of all the earth and from thence did the
LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth
