128 For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom to another
the word of knowledge by the same Spirit 129 To another faith by the
same Spirit to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit 1210
To another the working of miracles to another prophecy to another
discerning of spirits to another divers kinds of tongues to another
the interpretation of tongues 1211 But all these worketh that one
and the selfsame Spirit dividing to every man severally as he will

1212 For as the body is one and hath many members and all the
members of that one body being many are one body so also is Christ

1213 For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body whether we
be Jews or Gentiles whether we be bond or free and have been all
made to drink into one Spirit

1214 For the body is not one member but many

1215 If the foot shall say Because I am not the hand I am not of
the body is it therefore not of the body  1216 And if the ear shall
say Because I am not the eye I am not of the body is it therefore
not of the body  1217 If the whole body were an eye where were the
hearing If the whole were hearing where were the smelling  1218
But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body as it
hath pleased him

1219 And if they were all one member where were the body  1220 But
now are they many members yet but one body

1221 And the eye cannot say unto the hand I have no need of thee
nor again the head to the feet I have no need of you

1222 Nay much more those members of the body which seem to be more
feeble are necessary 1223 And those members of the body which we
think to be less honourable upon these we bestow more abundant
honour and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness

1224 For our comely parts have no need but God hath tempered the
body together having given more abundant honour to that part which
lacked

1225 That there should be no schism in the body but that the members
should have the same care one for another

1226 And whether one member suffer all the members suffer with it
or one member be honoured all the members rejoice with it

1227 Now ye are the body of Christ and members in particular

1228 And God hath set some in the church first apostles secondarily
prophets thirdly teachers after that miracles then gifts of
healings helps governments diversities of tongues

1229 Are all apostles are all prophets are all teachers are all
workers of miracles  1230 Have all the gifts of healing do all
speak with tongues do all interpret  1231 But covet earnestly the
best gifts and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way

131 Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels and have
not charity I am become as sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal

132 And though I have the gift of prophecy and understand all
mysteries and all knowledge and though I have all faith so that I
could remove mountains and have not charity I am nothing

133 And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though I
give my body to be burned and have not charity it profiteth me
nothing

134 Charity suffereth long and is kind charity envieth not charity
vaunteth not itself is not puffed up 135 Doth not behave itself
unseemly seeketh not her own is not easily provoked thinketh no
evil 136 Rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth 137
Beareth all things believeth all things hopeth all things endureth
all things

138 Charity never faileth but whether there be prophecies they
shall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there
be knowledge it shall vanish away

139 For we know in part and we prophesy in part

1310 But when that which is perfect is come then that which is in
part shall be done away

1311 When I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child
I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish
things

1312 For now we see through a glass darkly but then face to face
now I know in part but then shall I know even as also I am known

1313 And now abideth faith hope charity these three but the
greatest of these is charity

141 Follow after charity and desire spiritual gifts but rather that
ye may prophesy

142 For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men
but unto God for no man understandeth him howbeit in the spirit he
speaketh mysteries
