It pains him to speak of her Dany saw but she wanted to know the truth Is that all you would say of her The lion pelt slid off one shoulder and she tugged it back into place Was she beautiful

Very beautiful Ser Jorah lifted his eyes from her shoulder to her face The first time I beheld her I thought she was a goddess come to earth the Maid herself made flesh Her birth was far above my own She was the youngest daughter of Lord Leyton Hightower of Oldtown The White Bull who commanded your father’s Kingsguard was her great-uncle The Hightowers are an ancient family very rich and very proud

And loyal Dany said I remember Viserys said the Hightowers were among those who stayed true to my father

That’s so he admitted

Did your fathers make the match

No he said Our marriage… that makes a long tale and a dull one Your Grace I would not trouble you with it

I have nowhere to go she said Please

As my queen commands Ser Jorah frowned My home… you must understand that to understand the rest Bear Island is beautiful but remote Imagine old gnarled oaks and tall pines flowering thornbushes grey stones bearded with moss little creeks running icy down steep hillsides The hall of the Mormonts is built of huge logs and surrounded by an earthen palisade Aside from a few crofters my people live along the coasts and fish the seas The island lies far to the north and our winters are more terrible than you can imagine Khaleesi

Still the island suited me well enough and I never lacked for women I had my share of fishwives and crofter’s daughters before and after I was wed I married young to a bride of my father’s choosing a Glover of Deepwood Motte Ten years we were wed or near enough as makes no matter She was a plain-faced woman but not unkind I suppose I came to love her after a fashion though our relations were dutiful rather than passionate Three times she miscarried while trying to give me an heir The last time she never recovered She died not long after

Dany put her hand on his and gave his fingers a squeeze I am sorry for you truly

Ser Jorah nodded By then my father had taken the black so I was Lord of Bear Island in my own right I had no lack of marriage offers but before I could reach a decision Lord Balon Greyjoy rose in rebellion against the Usurper and Ned Stark called his banners to help his friend Robert The final battle was on Pyke When Robert’s stonethrowers opened a breach in King Balon’s wall a priest from Myr was the first man through but I was not far behind For that I won my knighthood

To celebrate his victory Robert ordained that a tourney should be held outside Lannisport It was there I saw Lynesse a maid half my age She had come up from Oldtown with her father to see her brothers joust I could not take my eyes off her In a fit of madness I begged her favor to wear in the tourney never dreaming she would grant my request yet she did

I fight as well as any man Khaleesi but I have never been a tourney knight Yet with Lynesse’s favor knotted round my arm I was a different man I won joust after joust Lord Jason Mallister fell before me and Bronze Yohn Royce Ser Ryman Frey his brother Ser Hosteen Lord Whent Strongboar even Ser Boros Blount of the Kingsguard I unhorsed them all In the last match I broke nine lances against Jaime Lannister to no result and King Robert gave me the champion’s laurel I crowned Lynesse queen of love and beauty and that very night went to her father and asked for her hand I was drunk as much on glory as on wine By rights I should have gotten a contemptuous refusal but Lord Leyton accepted my offer We were married there in Lannisport and for a fortnight I was the happiest man in the wide world

Only a fortnight asked Dany Even I was given more happiness than that with Drogo who was my sun-and-stars

A fortnight was how long it took us to sail from Lannisport back to Bear Island My home was a great disappointment to Lynesse It was too cold too damp too far away my castle no more than a wooden longhall We had no masques no mummer shows no balls or fairs Seasons might pass without a singer ever coming to play for us and there’s not a goldsmith on the island Even meals became a trial My cook knew little beyond his roasts and stews and Lynesse soon lost her taste for fish and venison

I lived for her smiles so I sent all the way to Oldtown for a new cook and brought a harper from Lannisport Goldsmiths jewelers dressmakers whatever she wanted I found for her but it was never enough Bear Island is rich in bears and trees and poor in aught else I built a fine ship for her and we sailed to Lannisport and Oldtown for festivals and fairs and once even to Braavos where I borrowed heavily from the money-lenders It was as a tourney champion that I had won her hand and heart so I entered other tourneys for her sake but the magic was gone I never distinguished myself again and each defeat meant the loss of another charger and another suit of jousting armor which must needs be ransomed or replaced The cost could not be borne Finally I insisted we return home but there matters soon grew even worse than before I could no longer pay the cook and the harper and Lynesse grew wild when I spoke of pawning her jewels

The rest… I did things it shames me to speak of For gold So Lynesse might keep her jewels her harper and her cook In the end it cost me all When I heard that Eddard Stark was coming to Bear Island I was so lost to honor that rather than stay and face his judgment I took her with me into exile Nothing mattered but our love I told myself We fled to Lys where I sold my ship for gold to keep us

His voice was thick with grief and Dany was reluctant to press him any further yet she had to know how it ended Did she die there she asked him gently

Only to me he said In half a year my gold was gone and I was obliged to take service as a sellsword While I was fighting Braavosi on the Rhoyne Lynesse moved into the manse of a merchant prince named Tregar Ormollen They say she is his chief concubine now and even his wife goes in fear of her

Dany was horrified Do you hate her

Almost as much as I love her Ser Jorah answered Pray excuse me my queen I find I am very tired

She gave him leave to go but as he was lifting the flap of her tent she could not stop herself calling after him with one last question What did she look like your Lady Lynesse

Ser Jorah smiled sadly Why she looked a bit like you Daenerys He bowed low Sleep well my queen

Dany shivered and pulled the lionskin tight about her She looked like me It explained much that she had not truly understood He wants me she realized He loves me as he loved her not as a knight loves his queen but as a man loves a woman She tried to imagine herself in Ser Jorah’s arms kissing him pleasuring him letting him enter her It was no good When she closed her eyes his face kept changing into Drogo’s

Khal Drogo had been her sun-and-stars her first and perhaps he must be her last The maegi Mirri Maz Duur had sworn she should never bear a living child and what man would want a barren wife And what man could hope to rival Drogo who had died with his hair uncut and rode now through the night lands the stars his khalasar

She had heard the longing in Ser Jorah’s voice when he spoke of his Bear Island He can never have me but one day I can give him back his home and honor That much I can do for him

No ghosts troubled her sleep that night She dreamed of Drogo and the first ride they had taken together on the night they were wed In the dream it was not horses they rode but dragons
