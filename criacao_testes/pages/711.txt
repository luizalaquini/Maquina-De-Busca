He won’t remember me but he used to come to our forge The Smallwood forge had not been used in some time though the smith had hung his tools neatly on the wall Gendry lit a candle and set it on the anvil while he took down a pair of tongs My master always scolded him about his flaming swords It was no way to treat good steel he’d say but this Thoros never used good steel He’d just dip some cheap sword in wildfire and set it alight It was only an alchemist’s trick my master said but it scared the horses and some of the greener knights

She screwed up her face trying to remember if her father had ever talked about Thoros He isn’t very priestly is he

No Gendry admitted Master Mott said Thoros could outdrink even King Robert They were pease in a pod he told me both gluttons and sots

You shouldn’t call the king a sot Maybe King Robert had drunk a lot but he’d been her father’s friend

I was talking about Thoros Gendry reached out with the tongs as if to pinch her face but Arya swatted them away He liked feasts and tourneys that was why King Robert was so fond of him And this Thoros was brave When the walls of Pyke crashed down he was the first through the breach He fought with one of his flaming swords setting ironmen afire with every slash

I wish I had a flaming sword Arya could think of lots of people she’d like to set on fire

It’s only a trick I told you The wildfire ruins the steel My master sold Thoros a new sword after every tourney Every time they would have a fight about the price Gendry hung the tongs back up and took down the heavy hammer Master Mott said it was time I made my first longsword He gave me a sweet piece of steel and I knew just how I wanted to shape the blade Only Yoren came and took me away for the Night’s Watch

You can still make swords if you want said Arya You can make them for my brother Robb when we get to Riverrun

Riverrun Gendry put the hammer down and looked at her You look different now Like a proper little girl

I look like an oak tree with all these stupid acorns

Nice though A nice oak tree He stepped closer and sniffed at her You even smell nice for a change

You don’t You stink Arya shoved him back against the anvil and made to run but Gendry caught her arm She stuck a foot between his legs and tripped him but he yanked her down with him and they rolled across the floor of the smithy He was very strong but she was quicker Every time he tried to hold her still she wriggled free and punched him Gendry only laughed at the blows which made her mad He finally caught both her wrists in one hand and started to tickle her with the other so Arya slammed her knee between his legs and wrenched free Both of them were covered in dirt and one sleeve was torn on her stupid acorn dress I bet I don’t look so nice now she shouted

Tom was singing when they returned to the hall





My featherbed is deep and soft

and there I’ll lay you down

I’ll dress you all in yellow silk

and on your head a crown

For you shall be my lady love

and I shall be your lord

I’ll always keep you warm and safe

and guard you with my sword





Harwin took one look at them and burst out laughing and Anguy smiled one of his stupid freckly smiles and said Are we certain this one is a highborn lady But Lem Lemoncloak gave Gendry a clout alongside the head You want to fight fight with me She’s a girl and half your age You keep your hands off o’ her you hear me

I started it said Arya Gendry was just talking
