1228 And the sons of the singers gathered themselves together both
out of the plain country round about Jerusalem and from the villages
of Netophathi 1229 Also from the house of Gilgal and out of the
fields of Geba and Azmaveth for the singers had builded them villages
round about Jerusalem

1230 And the priests and the Levites purified themselves and
purified the people and the gates and the wall

1231 Then I brought up the princes of Judah upon the wall and
appointed two great companies of them that gave thanks whereof one
went on the right hand upon the wall toward the dung gate 1232 And
after them went Hoshaiah and half of the princes of Judah 1233 And
Azariah Ezra and Meshullam 1234 Judah and Benjamin and Shemaiah
and Jeremiah 1235 And certain of the priests sons with trumpets
namely Zechariah the son of Jonathan the son of Shemaiah the son of
Mattaniah the son of Michaiah the son of Zaccur the son of Asaph
1236 And his brethren Shemaiah and Azarael Milalai Gilalai Maai
Nethaneel and Judah Hanani with the musical instruments of David
the man of God and Ezra the scribe before them

1237 And at the fountain gate which was over against them they went
up by the stairs of the city of David at the going up of the wall
above the house of David even unto the water gate eastward

1238 And the other company of them that gave thanks went over against
them and I after them and the half of the people upon the wall from
beyond the tower of the furnaces even unto the broad wall 1239 And
from above the gate of Ephraim and above the old gate and above the
fish gate and the tower of Hananeel and the tower of Meah even unto
the sheep gate and they stood still in the prison gate

1240 So stood the two companies of them that gave thanks in the house
of God and I and the half of the rulers with me 1241 And the
priests Eliakim Maaseiah Miniamin Michaiah Elioenai Zechariah
and Hananiah with trumpets 1242 And Maaseiah and Shemaiah and
Eleazar and Uzzi and Jehohanan and Malchijah and Elam and Ezer
And the singers sang loud with Jezrahiah their overseer

1243 Also that day they offered great sacrifices and rejoiced for
God had made them rejoice with great joy the wives also and the
children rejoiced so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard even afar
off

1244 And at that time were some appointed over the chambers for the
treasures for the offerings for the firstfruits and for the tithes
to gather into them out of the fields of the cities the portions of
the law for the priests and Levites for Judah rejoiced for the
priests and for the Levites that waited

1245 And both the singers and the porters kept the ward of their God
and the ward of the purification according to the commandment of
David and of Solomon his son

1246 For in the days of David and Asaph of old there were chief of
the singers and songs of praise and thanksgiving unto God

1247 And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel and in the days of
Nehemiah gave the portions of the singers and the porters every day
his portion and they sanctified holy things unto the Levites and the
Levites sanctified them unto the children of Aaron

131 On that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the
people and therein was found written that the Ammonite and the
Moabite should not come into the congregation of God for ever 132
Because they met not the children of Israel with bread and with water
but hired Balaam against them that he should curse them howbeit our
God turned the curse into a blessing

133 Now it came to pass when they had heard the law that they
separated from Israel all the mixed multitude

134 And before this Eliashib the priest having the oversight of the
chamber of the house of our God was allied unto Tobiah 135 And he
had prepared for him a great chamber where aforetime they laid the
meat offerings the frankincense and the vessels and the tithes of
the corn the new wine and the oil which was commanded to be given
to the Levites and the singers and the porters and the offerings of
the priests

136 But in all this time was not I at Jerusalem for in the two and
thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon came I unto the king and
after certain days obtained I leave of the king 137 And I came to
Jerusalem and understood of the evil that Eliashib did for Tobiah in
preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of God

138 And it grieved me sore therefore I cast forth all the household
stuff to Tobiah out of the chamber

139 Then I commanded and they cleansed the chambers and thither
brought I again the vessels of the house of God with the meat
offering and the frankincense

1310 And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been
given them for the Levites and the singers that did the work were
fled every one to his field

1311 Then contended I with the rulers and said Why is the house of
God forsaken And I gathered them together and set them in their
place
