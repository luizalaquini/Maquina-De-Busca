Tyrion Lannister’s laughter steamed in the cold air I’ll be sure to tell your father to arrest more stonemasons before your tower collapses

Jon could taste the mockery there but there was no denying the truth The Watch had built nineteen great strongholds along the Wall but only three were still occupied Eastwatch on its grey windswept shore the Shadow Tower hard by the mountains where the Wall ended and Castle Black between them at the end of the kingsroad The other keeps long deserted were lonely haunted places where cold winds whistled through black windows and the spirits of the dead manned the parapets

It’s better that I’m by myself Jon said stubbornly The rest of them are scared of Ghost

Wise boys Lannister said Then he changed the subject The talk is your uncle is too long away

Jon remembered the wish he’d wished in his anger the vision of Benjen Stark dead in the snow and he looked away quickly The dwarf had a way of sensing things and Jon did not want him to see the guilt in his eyes He said he’d be back by my name day he admitted His name day had come and gone unremarked a fortnight past They were looking for Ser Waymar Royce his father is bannerman to Lord Arryn Uncle Benjen said they might search as far as the Shadow Tower That’s all the way up in the mountains

I hear that a good many rangers have vanished of late Lannister said as they mounted the steps to the common hall He grinned and pulled open the door Perhaps the grumkins are hungry this year

Inside the hall was immense and drafty even with a fire roaring in its great hearth Crows nested in the timbers of its lofty ceiling Jon heard their cries overhead as he accepted a bowl of stew and a heel of black bread from the day’s cooks Grenn and Toad and some of the others were seated at the bench nearest the warmth laughing and cursing each other in rough voices Jon eyed them thoughtfully for a moment Then he chose a spot at the far end of the hall well away from the other diners

Tyrion Lannister sat across from him sniffing at the stew suspiciously Barley onion carrot he muttered Someone should tell the cooks that turnip isn’t a meat

It’s mutton stew Jon pulled off his gloves and warmed his hands in the steam rising from the bowl The smell made his mouth water

Snow

Jon knew Alliser Thorne’s voice but there was a curious note in it that he had not heard before He turned

The Lord Commander wants to see you Now

For a moment Jon was too frightened to move Why would the Lord Commander want to see him They had heard something about Benjen he thought wildly he was dead the vision had come true Is it my uncle he blurted Is he returned safe

The Lord Commander is not accustomed to waiting was Ser Alliser’s reply And I am not accustomed to having my commands questioned by bastards

Tyrion Lannister swung off the bench and rose Stop it Thorne You’re frightening the boy

Keep out of matters that don’t concern you Lannister You have no place here

I have a place at court though the dwarf said smiling A word in the right ear and you’ll die a sour old man before you get another boy to train Now tell Snow why the Old Bear needs to see him Is there news of his uncle

No Ser Alliser said This is another matter entirely A bird arrived this morning from Winterfell with a message that concerns his brother He corrected himself His half brother

Bran Jon breathed scrambling to his feet Something’s happened to Bran

Tyrion Lannister laid a hand on his arm Jon he said I am truly sorry

Jon scarcely heard him He brushed off Tyrion’s hand and strode across the hall He was running by the time he hit the doors He raced to the Commander’s Keep dashing through drifts of old snow When the guards passed him he took the tower steps two at a time By the time he burst into the presence of the Lord Commander his boots were soaked and Jon was wild-eyed and panting Bran he said What does it say about Bran

Jeor Mormont Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch was a gruff old man with an immense bald head and a shaggy grey beard He had a raven on his arm and he was feeding it kernels of corn I am told you can read He shook the raven off and it flapped its wings and flew to the window where it sat watching as Mormont drew a roll of paper from his belt and handed it to Jon Corn it muttered in a raucous voice Corn corn

Jon’s finger traced the outline of the direwolf in the white wax of the broken seat He recognized Robb’s hand but the letters seemed to blur and run as he tried to read them He realized he was crying And then through the tears he found the sense in the words and raised his head He woke up he said The gods gave him back

Crippled Mormont said I’m sorry boy Read the rest of the letter

He looked at the words but they didn’t matter Nothing mattered Bran was going to live My brother is going to live he told Mormont The Lord Commander shook his head gathered up a fistful of corn and whistled The raven flew to his shoulder crying Live Live

Jon ran down the stairs a smile on his face and Robb’s letter in his hand My brother is going to live he told the guards They exchanged a look He ran back to the common hall where he found Tyrion Lannister just finishing his meal He grabbed the little man under the arms hoisted him up in the air and spun him around in a circle Bran is going to live he whooped Lannister looked startled Jon put him down and thrust the paper into his hands Here read it he said

Others were gathering around and looking at him curiously Jon noticed Grenn a few feet away A thick woolen bandage was wrapped around one hand He looked anxious and uncomfortable not menacing at all Jon went to him Grenn edged backward and put up his hands Stay away from me now you bastard
