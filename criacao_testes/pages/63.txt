the seventh day for to gather and they found none

1628 And the LORD said unto Moses How long refuse ye to keep my
commandments and my laws  1629 See for that the LORD hath given you
the sabbath therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two
days abide ye every man in his place let no man go out of his place
on the seventh day

1630 So the people rested on the seventh day

1631 And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna and it
was like coriander seed white and the taste of it was like wafers
made with honey

1632 And Moses said This is the thing which the LORD commandeth
Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations that they may see
the bread wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness when I brought
you forth from the land of Egypt

1633 And Moses said unto Aaron Take a pot and put an omer full of
manna therein and lay it up before the LORD to be kept for your
generations

1634 As the LORD commanded Moses so Aaron laid it up before the
Testimony to be kept

1635 And the children of Israel did eat manna forty years until they
came to a land inhabited they did eat manna until they came unto the
borders of the land of Canaan

1636 Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah

171 And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from
the wilderness of Sin after their journeys according to the
commandment of the LORD and pitched in Rephidim and there was no
water for the people to drink

172 Wherefore the people did chide with Moses and said Give us
water that we may drink And Moses said unto them Why chide ye with
me wherefore do ye tempt the LORD  173 And the people thirsted
there for water and the people murmured against Moses and said
Wherefore is this that thou hast brought us up out of Egypt to kill
us and our children and our cattle with thirst  174 And Moses cried
unto the LORD saying What shall I do unto this people they be
almost ready to stone me

175 And the LORD said unto Moses Go on before the people and take
with thee of the elders of Israel and thy rod wherewith thou smotest
the river take in thine hand and go

176 Behold I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb
and thou shalt smite the rock and there shall come water out of it
that the people may drink And Moses did so in the sight of the elders
of Israel

177 And he called the name of the place Massah and Meribah because
of the chiding of the children of Israel and because they tempted the
LORD saying Is the LORD among us or not  178 Then came Amalek
and fought with Israel in Rephidim

179 And Moses said unto Joshua Choose us out men and go out fight
with Amalek to morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the
rod of God in mine hand

1710 So Joshua did as Moses had said to him and fought with Amalek
and Moses Aaron and Hur went up to the top of the hill

1711 And it came to pass when Moses held up his hand that Israel
prevailed and when he let down his hand Amalek prevailed

1712 But Moses hands were heavy and they took a stone and put it
under him and he sat thereon and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands
the one on the one side and the other on the other side and his
hands were steady until the going down of the sun

1713 And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of
the sword

1714 And the LORD said unto Moses Write this for a memorial in a
book and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua for I will utterly put
out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven

1715 And Moses built an altar and called the name of it
Jehovahnissi 1716 For he said Because the LORD hath sworn that the
LORD will have war with Amalek from generation to generation

181 When Jethro the priest of Midian Moses father in law heard of
all that God had done for Moses and for Israel his people and that
the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt 182 Then Jethro Moses
father in law took Zipporah Moses wife after he had sent her back
183 And her two sons of which the name of the one was Gershom for
he said I have been an alien in a strange land 184 And the name of
the other was Eliezer for the God of my father said he was mine
help and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh 185 And Jethro
Moses father in law came with his sons and his wife unto Moses into
the wilderness where he encamped at the mount of God 186 And he
said unto Moses I thy father in law Jethro am come unto thee and thy
wife and her two sons with her

187 And Moses went out to meet his father in law and did obeisance
