and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head and she
began to afflict him and his strength went from him

1620 And she said The Philistines be upon thee Samson And he awoke
out of his sleep and said I will go out as at other times before
and shake myself And he wist not that the LORD was departed from him

1621 But the Philistines took him and put out his eyes and brought
him down to Gaza and bound him with fetters of brass and he did
grind in the prison house

1622 Howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he was
shaven

1623 Then the lords of the Philistines gathered them together for to
offer a great sacrifice unto Dagon their god and to rejoice for they
said Our god hath delivered Samson our enemy into our hand

1624 And when the people saw him they praised their god for they
said Our god hath delivered into our hands our enemy and the
destroyer of our country which slew many of us

1625 And it came to pass when their hearts were merry that they
said Call for Samson that he may make us sport And they called for
Samson out of the prison house and he made them sport and they set
him between the pillars

1626 And Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand Suffer
me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house standeth that I
may lean upon them

1627 Now the house was full of men and women and all the lords of
the Philistines were there and there were upon the roof about three
thousand men and women that beheld while Samson made sport

1628 And Samson called unto the LORD and said O Lord God remember
me I pray thee and strengthen me I pray thee only this once O
God that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes

1629 And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the
house stood and on which it was borne up of the one with his right
hand and of the other with his left

1630 And Samson said Let me die with the Philistines And he bowed
himself with all his might and the house fell upon the lords and
upon all the people that were therein So the dead which he slew at
his death were more than they which he slew in his life

1631 Then his brethren and all the house of his father came down and
took him and brought him up and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol
in the buryingplace of Manoah his father And he judged Israel twenty
years

171 And there was a man of mount Ephraim whose name was Micah

172 And he said unto his mother The eleven hundred shekels of silver
that were taken from thee about which thou cursedst and spakest of
also in mine ears behold the silver is with me I took it And his
mother said Blessed be thou of the LORD my son

173 And when he had restored the eleven hundred shekels of silver to
his mother his mother said I had wholly dedicated the silver unto
the LORD from my hand for my son to make a graven image and a molten
image now therefore I will restore it unto thee

174 Yet he restored the money unto his mother and his mother took
two hundred shekels of silver and gave them to the founder who made
thereof a graven image and a molten image and they were in the house
of Micah

175 And the man Micah had an house of gods and made an ephod and
teraphim and consecrated one of his sons who became his priest

176 In those days there was no king in Israel but every man did that
which was right in his own eyes

177 And there was a young man out of Bethlehemjudah of the family of
Judah who was a Levite and he sojourned there

178 And the man departed out of the city from Bethlehemjudah to
sojourn where he could find a place and he came to mount Ephraim to
the house of Micah as he journeyed

179 And Micah said unto him Whence comest thou And he said unto
him I am a Levite of Bethlehemjudah and I go to sojourn where I may
find a place

1710 And Micah said unto him Dwell with me and be unto me a father
and a priest and I will give thee ten shekels of silver by the year
and a suit of apparel and thy victuals So the Levite went in

1711 And the Levite was content to dwell with the man and the young
man was unto him as one of his sons

1712 And Micah consecrated the Levite and the young man became his
priest and was in the house of Micah

1713 Then said Micah Now know I that the LORD will do me good
seeing I have a Levite to my priest
