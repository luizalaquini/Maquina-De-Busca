broadcast battle as the Capitol tech masters try to fend off
Beetees attack But they are unprepared and Beetee
apparently anticipating he would not hold on to control has
an arsenal of five- to ten-second clips to work with We
watch the official presentation deteriorate as its peppered
with choice shots from the propos
Plutarchs in spasms of delight and most everybody is
cheering Beetee on but Finnick remains still and
speechless beside me I meet Haymitchs eyes from
across the room and see my own dread mirrored back The
recognition that with every cheer Peeta slips even farther
from our grasp
The Capitol seals back up accompanied by a flat
audio tone This lasts about twenty seconds before Snow
and Peeta return The set is in turmoil Were hearing frantic
exchanges from their booth Snow plows forward saying
that clearly the rebels are now attempting to disrupt the
dissemination of information they find incriminating but
both truth and justice will reign The full broadcast will
resume when security has been reinstated He asks Peeta
if given tonights demonstration he has any parting
thoughts for Katniss Everdeen
At the mention of my name Peetas face contorts in
effort Katnisshow do you think this will end What will be
left No one is safe Not in the Capitol Not in the districts
And youin Thirteen He inhales sharply as if fighting for
air his eyes look insane Dead by morning
Off camera Snow orders End it Beetee throws the
whole thing into chaos by flashing a still shot of me standing
in front of the hospital at three-second intervals But
between the images we are privy to the real-life action
being played out on the set Peetas attempt to continue
speaking The camera knocked down to record the white
tiled floor The scuffle of boots The impact of the blow thats
inseparable from Peetas cry of pain
And his blood as it splatters the tiles
PART II
THE ASSAULT
10
The scream begins in my lower back and works its
way up through my body only to jam in my throat I am Avox
mute choking on my grief Even if I could release the
muscles in my neck let the sound tear into space would
anyone notice it The rooms in an uproar Questions and
demands ring out as they try to decipher Peetas words
And youin Thirteendead by morning Yet no one is
asking about the messenger whose blood has been
replaced by static
A voice calls the others to attention Shut up Every
pair of eyes falls on Haymitch Its not some big mystery
The boys telling us were about to be attacked Here In
Thirteen
How would he have that information
Why should we trust him
How do you know
Haymitch gives a growl of frustration Theyre beating
him bloody while we speak What more do you need
Katniss help me out here
I have to give myself a shake to free my words
Haymitchs right I dont know where Peeta got the
information Or if its true But he believes it is And theyre--
 I cant say aloud what Snows doing to him
You dont know him Haymitch says to Coin We do
Get your people ready
The president doesnt seem alarmed only somewhat
perplexed by this turn in events She mulls over the words
tapping one finger lightly on the rim of the control board in
front of her When she speaks she addresses Haymitch in
an even voice Of course we have prepared for such a
scenario Although we have decades of support for the
assumption that further direct attacks on Thirteen would be
counterproductive to the Capitols cause Nuclear missiles
would release radiation into the atmosphere with
incalculable environmental results Even routine bombing
could badly damage our military compound which we know
they hope to regain And of course they invite a
counterstrike It is conceivable that given our current
alliance with the rebels those would be viewed as
acceptable risks
You think so says Haymitch Its a shade too
sincere but the subtleties of irony are often wasted in 13
I do At any rate were overdue for a Level Five
security drill says Coin Lets proceed with the lockdown
She begins to type rapidly on her keyboard authorizing her
decision The moment she raises her head it begins
There have been two low-level drills since I arrived in
13 I dont remember much about the first I was in intensive
care in the hospital and I think the patients were exempted
as the complications of removing us for a practice drill
outweighed the benefits I was vaguely aware of a
mechanical voice instructing people to congregate in yellow
zones During the second a Level Two drill meant for minor
crises--such as a temporary quarantine while citizens were
tested for contagion during a flu outbreak--we were
supposed to return to our living quarters I stayed behind a
pipe in the laundry room ignored the pulsating beeps
coming over the audio system and watched a spider
construct a web Neither experience has prepared me for
the wordless eardrum-piercing fear-inducing sirens that
now permeate 13 There would be no disregarding this
