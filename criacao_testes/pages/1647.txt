a great deal to come before that

  `Call the first witness said the King and the White Rabbit
blew three blasts on the trumpet and called out `First
witness

  The first witness was the Hatter  He came in with a teacup in
one hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other  `I beg
pardon your Majesty he began `for bringing these in  but I
hadnt quite finished my tea when I was sent for

  `You ought to have finished said the King  `When did you
begin

  The Hatter looked at the March Hare who had followed him into
the court arm-in-arm with the Dormouse  `Fourteenth of March I
think it was he said

  `Fifteenth said the March Hare

  `Sixteenth added the Dormouse

  `Write that down the King said to the jury and the jury
eagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates and then
added them up and reduced the answer to shillings and pence

  `Take off your hat the King said to the Hatter

  `It isnt mine said the Hatter

  `Stolen the King exclaimed turning to the jury who
instantly made a memorandum of the fact

  `I keep them to sell the Hatter added as an explanation
`Ive none of my own  Im a hatter

  Here the Queen put on her spectacles and began staring at the
Hatter who turned pale and fidgeted

  `Give your evidence said the King `and dont be nervous or
Ill have you executed on the spot

  This did not seem to encourage the witness at all  he kept
shifting from one foot to the other looking uneasily at the
Queen and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his
teacup instead of the bread-and-butter

  Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation which
puzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was  she was
beginning to grow larger again and she thought at first she
would get up and leave the court but on second thoughts she
decided to remain where she was as long as there was room for
her

  `I wish you wouldnt squeeze so said the Dormouse who was
sitting next to her  `I can hardly breathe

  `I cant help it said Alice very meekly  `Im growing

  `Youve no right to grow here said the Dormouse

  `Dont talk nonsense said Alice more boldly  `you know
youre growing too

  `Yes but I grow at a reasonable pace said the Dormouse
`not in that ridiculous fashion  And he got up very sulkily
and crossed over to the other side of the court

  All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the
Hatter and just as the Dormouse crossed the court she said to
one of the officers of the court `Bring me the list of the
singers in the last concert on which the wretched Hatter
trembled so that he shook both his shoes off

  `Give your evidence the King repeated angrily `or Ill have
you executed whether youre nervous or not

  `Im a poor man your Majesty the Hatter began in a
trembling voice `--and I hadnt begun my tea--not above a week
or so--and what with the bread-and-butter getting so thin--and
the twinkling of the tea--

  `The twinkling of the what said the King

  `It began with the tea the Hatter replied

  `Of course twinkling begins with a T said the King sharply
`Do you take me for a dunce  Go on

  `Im a poor man the Hatter went on `and most things
twinkled after that--only the March Hare said--

  `I didnt the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry

  `You did said the Hatter

  `I deny it said the March Hare

  `He denies it said the King  `leave out that part
