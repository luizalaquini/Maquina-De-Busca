sounds like aaah which have their source in larynx vibration are
known technically as voiced  Aspirated and fricative sounds are called
unvoiced  Thus the three different sound types can be classified as
LB
NP
voiced
NP
unvoiced fricative
NP
unvoiced aspirated
LE
Can any of these three types occur together
It would seem that voicing and aspiration can not for the former requires
the larynx to be vibrating regularly but for the latter it must be
generating turbulent noise
However there is a condition known technically as breathy voice
which occurs when the vocal cords are slightly apart still vibrating
but with a large volume of air passing between to create turbulence
Voicing can easily occur in conjunction with frication

the sound in the middle of words like vision which I will call

A simple illustration of voicing is to say ffffvvvvffff 
During the voiced part you can feel the larynx vibrations with a finger
on your Adams apple and it can be heard quite clearly if you stop up
your ears
Technically there is nothing to prevent frication and aspiration
from occurring together em they do for example when a voiced fricative
is whispered em but the combination is not an important one

rh The source-filter model of speech production
We have been talking in terms of a sound source be it voiced or unvoiced
exciting the resonances of the oral and possible the nasal tract
This model which is used extensively in speech analysis and synthesis
is known as
the source-filter model of speech production  The reason for its success
is that the effect of the resonances can be modelled as a frequency-selective
filter operating on an input which is the source excitation
Thus the frequency spectrum of the source is modified by multiplying it
by the frequency characteristic of the filter or adding it if amplitudes
are expressed logarithmically
This can be seen in Figure 25 which shows a source
spectrum and filter characteristic which combine to give the overall
spectrum of Figure 22
FC Figure 25
pp
Although as mentioned above the various fricatives are not subjected
to the resonances of the vocal tract to the same extent
that voiced and aspirated
sounds are they can still be modelled as a noise source followed by
a filter to give them their different sound qualities
pp
The source-filter model is an oversimplification of the actual speech
production system  There is inevitably some coupling between the vocal
tract and the lungs through the glottis during the period when
it is open  This effectively makes the filter characteristics
change during each individual cycle of the excitation
However although the effect is of interest to speech researchers
it is probably not of great significance for practical speech output
pp
One very interesting implication of the
source-filter model is that the prosodic features of
pitch and amplitude are largely properties of the source while
segmental ones are introduced by the filter  This makes it possible to
separate some aspects of
overall prosody from the actual segmental content of an
utterance so that for example a human utterance can be stored initially
and then spoken by a machine with a variety of different intonations
sh 22  Classification of speech sounds
pp
The need to classify sound segments as a basis for storing generalized acoustic
information and retrieving it was mentioned earlier  There is a real
difficulty here because speech is by nature continuous and classifications are
discrete
It is important to remember this difficulty because it is all too easy
to criticize the complex and often confusing attempts of linguists to
tackle the classification task
