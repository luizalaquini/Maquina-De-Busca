The wench is dead the woman hissed Only worms may kiss her now And then to Tom Sevenstrings she said I’ll have my song or I’ll have you gone

So the singer played for her so soft and sad that Arya only heard snatches of the words though the tune was half-familiar Sansa would know it I bet Her sister had known all the songs and she could even play a little and sing so sweetly All I could ever do was shout the words

The next morning the little white woman was nowhere to be seen As they saddled their horses Arya asked Tom Sevenstrings if the children of the forest still dwelled on High Heart The singer chuckled Saw her did you

Was she a ghost

Do ghosts complain of how their joints creak No she’s only an old dwarf woman A queer one though and evil-eyed But she knows things she has no business knowing and sometimes she’ll tell you if she likes the look of you

Did she like the looks of you Arya asked doubtfully

The singer laughed The sound of me at least She always makes me sing the same bloody song though Not a bad song mind you but I know others just as good He shook his head What matters is we have the scent now You’ll soon be seeing Thoros and the lightning lord I’ll wager

If you’re their men why do they hide from you

Tom Sevenstrings rolled his eyes at that but Harwin gave her an answer I wouldn’t call it hiding milady but it’s true Lord Beric moves about a lot and seldom lets on what his plans are That way no one can betray him By now there must be hundreds of us sworn to him maybe thousands but it wouldn’t do for us all to trail along behind him We’d eat the country bare or get butchered in a battle by some bigger host The way we’re scattered in little bands we can strike in a dozen places at once and be off somewhere else before they know And when one of us is caught and put to the question well we can’t tell them where to find Lord Beric no matter what they do to us He hesitated You know what it means to be put to the question

Arya nodded Tickling they called it Polliver and Raff and all She told them about the village by the Gods Eye where she and Gendry had been caught and the questions that the Tickler had asked Is there gold hidden in the village he would always begin Silver gems Is there food Where is Lord Beric Which of you village folk helped him Where did he go How many men did he have with him How many knights How many bowmen How many were horsed How are they armed How many wounded Where did they go did you say Just thinking of it she could hear the shrieks again and smell the stench of blood and shit and burning flesh He always asked the same questions she told the outlaws solemnly but he changed the tickling every day

No child should be made to suffer that Harwin said when she was done The Mountain lost half his men at the Stone Mill we hear Might be this Tickler’s floating down the Red Fork even now with fish biting at his face If not well it’s one more crime they’ll answer for I’ve heard his lordship say this war began when the Hand sent him out to bring the king’s justice to Gregor Clegane and that’s how he means for it to end He gave her shoulder a reassuring pat You best mount up milady It’s a long day’s ride to Acorn Hall but at the end of it we’ll have a roof above our heads and a hot supper in our bellies

It was a long day’s ride but as dusk was settling they forded a brook and came up on Acorn Hall with its stone curtain walls and great oaken keep Its master was away fighting in the retinue of his master Lord Vance the castle gates closed and barred in his absence But his lady wife was an old friend of Tom Sevenstrings and Anguy said they’d once been lovers Anguy often rode beside her he was closer to her in age than any of them but Gendry and he told her droll tales of the Dornish Marches He never fooled her though He’s not my friend He’s only staying close to watch me and make sure I don’t ride off again Well Arya could watch as well Syrio Forel had taught her how

Lady Smallwood welcomed the outlaws kindly enough though she gave them a tongue lashing for dragging a young girl through the war She became even more wroth when Lem let slip that Arya was highborn Who dressed the poor child in those Bolton rags she demanded of them That badge… there’s many a man who would hang her in half a heartbeat for wearing a flayed man on her breast Arya promptly found herself marched upstairs forced into a tub and doused with scalding hot water Lady Smallwood’s maidservants scrubbed her so hard it felt like they were flaying her themselves They even dumped in some stinky-sweet stuff that smelled like flowers

And afterward they insisted she dress herself in girl’s things brown woolen stockings and a light linen shift and over that a light green gown with acorns embroidered all over the bodice in brown thread and more acorns bordering the hem My great-aunt is a septa at a motherhouse in Oldtown Lady Smallwood said as the women laced the gown up Arya’s back I sent my daughter there when the war began She’ll have outgrown these things by the time she returns no doubt Are you fond of dancing child My Carellen’s a lovely dancer She sings beautifully as well What do you like to do

She scuffed a toe amongst the rushes Needlework

Very restful isn’t it

Well said Arya not the way I do it

No I have always found it so The gods give each of us our little gifts and talents and it is meant for us to use them my aunt always says Any act can be a prayer if done as well as we are able Isn’t that a lovely thought Remember that the next time you do your needlework Do you work at it every day

I did till I lost Needle My new one’s not as good

In times like these we all must make do as best we can Lady Smallwood fussed at the bodice of the gown Now you look a proper young lady

I’m not a lady Arya wanted to tell her I’m a wolf

I do not know who you are child the woman said and it may be that’s for the best Someone important I fear She smoothed down Arya’s collar In times like these it is better to be insignificant Would that I could keep you here with me That would not be safe though I have walls but too few men to hold them She sighed

Supper was being served in the hall by the time Arya was all washed and combed and dressed Gendry took one look and laughed so hard that wine came out his nose until Harwin gave him a thwack alongside his ear The meal was plain but filling mutton and mushrooms brown bread pease pudding and baked apples with yellow cheese When the food had been cleared and the servants sent away Greenbeard lowered his voice to ask if her ladyship had word of the lightning lord

Word She smiled They were here not a fortnight past Them and a dozen more driving sheep I could scarcely believe my eyes Thoros gave me three as thanks You’ve eaten one tonight

Thoros herding sheep Anguy laughed aloud

I grant you it was an odd sight but Thoros claimed that as a priest he knew how to tend a flock

Aye and shear them too chuckled Lem Lemoncloak
