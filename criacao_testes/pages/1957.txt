FG Table 74  Rule table for an event-based synthesis-by-rule program
pp
Now the rule table which is shown in Table 74
holds simple target positions for each phoneme segment as well as
the segment type  The latter is used to trigger events by computer
procedures which have access to the context of the segment
In principle this allows considerably more sophistication to be
introduced than does a simple segment-by-segment approach

FG Table 75  Some coarticulation effects
pp
For example Table 75 summarizes some of the subtleties of the
speech production process which have been mentioned earlier in this
chapter  Most of them are context-dependent with the prosodic
context whether two segments are in the same syllable whether a
syllable is stressed playing a significant role  A scheme where
data-dependent demons fire on particular patterns in a linked list
seems to be a sensible approach towards incorporating such rules
rh Discussion
There are two opposing trends in speech synthesis by rule
On the one hand larger and larger segment inventories can be used
containing more and more allophones explicitly
This is the approach of the Votrax sound-segment synthesizer
discussed in Chapter 11
It puts an increasing burden on the person who codes the utterances
for synthesis although as we shall see computer programs can assist with
this task
On the other hand the segment inventory can be kept small perhaps
comprising just the logical phonemes as in the ISP system
This places the onus on the computer program to accomodate allophonic variations
and to do so it must take account of the segmental and prosodic
context of each phoneme
An event-based approach seems to give the best chance of incorporating
contextual modification whilst avoiding undesired interactions
pp
The second trend brings synthesis closer to the articulatory process
of speech production  In fact an event-based system would be
an ideal way of implementing an articulatory model for speech synthesis
by rule  It would be much more satisfying to have the rule table
contain articulatory target positions instead of resonance ones
with events like begin tongue motion towards upper teeth with a given
effort  The problem is that hard data on articulatory postures and
constraints is much more difficult to gather than resonance information
pp
An interesting question that relates to articulation is whether formant
motion can be simulated adequately by a small number of linear pieces
The segment-by-segment system described above had as many as nine
pieces for a single phoneme for some phonemes had three phases
and each one contributes up to three pieces transition in
steady state and transition out
Another system used curves of decaying exponential
