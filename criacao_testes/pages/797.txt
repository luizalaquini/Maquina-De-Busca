Did you look Jon asked as the sound rolled away and the night turned black again Did you see

Yellow she said Is that what you meant Some o’ them standing stones on top were yellow

We call them merlons They were painted gold a long time ago This is Queenscrown

Across the lake the tower was black again a dim shape dimly seen A queen lived there asked Ygritte

A queen stayed there for a night Old Nan had told him the story but Maester Luwin had confirmed most of it Alysanne the wife of King Jaehaerys the Conciliator He’s called the Old King because he reigned so long but he was young when he first came to the Iron Throne In those days it was his wont to travel all over the realm When he came to Winterfell he brought his queen six dragons and half his court The king had matters to discuss with his Warden of the North and Alysanne grew bored so she mounted her dragon Silverwing and flew north to see the Wall This village was one of the places where she stopped Afterward the smallfolk painted the top of their holdfast to look like the golden crown she’d worn when she spent the night among them

I have never seen a dragon

No one has The last dragons died a hundred years ago or more But this was before that

Queen Alysanne you say

Good Queen Alysanne they called her later One of the castles on the Wall was named for her as well Queensgate Before her visit they called it Snowgate

If she was so good she should have torn that Wall down

No he thought The Wall protects the realm From the Others… and from you and your kind as well sweetling I had another friend who dreamed of dragons A dwarf He told me—

JON SNOW One of the Thenns loomed above them frowning Magnar wants Jon thought it might have been the same man who’d found him outside the cave the night before they climbed the Wall but he could not be sure He got to his feet Ygritte came with him which always made Styr frown but whenever he tried to dismiss her she would remind him that she was a free woman not a kneeler She came and went as she pleased

They found the Magnar standing beneath the tree that grew through the floor of the common room His captive knelt before the hearth encircled by wooden spears and bronze swords He watched Jon approach but did not speak The rain was running down the walls and pattering against the last few leaves that still clung to the tree while smoke swirled thick from the fire

He must die Styr the Magnar said Do it crow

The old man said no word He only looked at Jon standing amongst the wildlings Amidst the rain and smoke lit only by the fire he could not have seen that Jon was all in black but for his sheepskin cloak Or could he

Jon drew Longclaw from its sheath Rain washed the steel and the firelight traced a sullen orange line along the edge Such a small fire to cost a man his life He remembered what Qhorin Halfhand had said when they spied the fire in the Skirling Pass Fire is life up here he told them but it can be death as well That was high in the Frostfangs though in the lawless wild beyond the Wall This was the Gift protected by the Night’s Watch and the power of Winterfell A man should have been free to build a fire here without dying for it

Why do you hesitate Styr said Kill him and be done

Even then the captive did not speak Mercy he might have said or You have taken my horse my coin my food let me keep my life or No please I have done you no harm He might have said a thousand things or wept or called upon his gods No words would save him now though Perhaps he knew that So he held his tongue and looked at Jon in accusation and appeal

You must not balk whatever is asked of you Ride with them eat with them fight with them… but this old man had offered no resistance He had been unlucky that was all Who he was where he came from where he meant to go on his sorry sway-backed horse… none of it mattered

He is an old man Jon told himself Fifty maybe even sixty He lived a longer life than most The Thenns will kill him anyway nothing I can say or do will save him Longclaw seemed heavier than lead in his hand too heavy to lift The man kept staring at him with eyes as big and black as wells I will fall into those eyes and drown The Magnar was looking at him too and he could almost taste the mistrust The man is dead What matter if it is my hand that slays him One cut would do it quick and clean Longclaw was forged of Valyrian steel Like Ice Jon remembered another killing the deserter on his knees his head rolling the brightness of blood on snow… his father’s sword his father’s words his father’s face…

Do it Jon Snow Ygritte urged You must T’ prove you are no crow but one o’ the free folk

An old man sitting by a fire

Orell was sitting by a fire too You killed him quick enough The look she gave him then was hard You meant t’ kill me too till you saw I was a woman And I was asleep

That was different You were soldiers… sentries

Aye and you crows didn’t want t’ be seen No more’n we do now It’s just the same Kill him

He turned his back on the man No

The Magnar moved closer tall cold and dangerous I say yes I command here
