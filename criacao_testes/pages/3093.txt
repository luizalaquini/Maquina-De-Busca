2725 The ships of Tarshish did sing of thee in thy market and thou
wast replenished and made very glorious in the midst of the seas

2726 Thy rowers have brought thee into great waters the east wind
hath broken thee in the midst of the seas

2727 Thy riches and thy fairs thy merchandise thy mariners and
thy pilots thy calkers and the occupiers of thy merchandise and all
thy men of war that are in thee and in all thy company which is in
the midst of thee shall fall into the midst of the seas in the day of
thy ruin

2728 The suburbs shall shake at the sound of the cry of thy pilots

2729 And all that handle the oar the mariners and all the pilots of
the sea shall come down from their ships they shall stand upon the
land 2730 And shall cause their voice to be heard against thee and
shall cry bitterly and shall cast up dust upon their heads they
shall wallow themselves in the ashes 2731 And they shall make
themselves utterly bald for thee and gird them with sackcloth and
they shall weep for thee with bitterness of heart and bitter wailing

2732 And in their wailing they shall take up a lamentation for thee
and lament over thee saying What city is like Tyrus like the
destroyed in the midst of the sea  2733 When thy wares went forth
out of the seas thou filledst many people thou didst enrich the
kings of the earth with the multitude of thy riches and of thy
merchandise

2734 In the time when thou shalt be broken by the seas in the depths
of the waters thy merchandise and all thy company in the midst of thee
shall fall

2735 All the inhabitants of the isles shall be astonished at thee
and their kings shall be sore afraid they shall be troubled in their
countenance

2736 The merchants among the people shall hiss at thee thou shalt be
a terror and never shalt be any more

281 The word of the LORD came again unto me saying 282 Son of man
say unto the prince of Tyrus Thus saith the Lord GOD Because thine
heart is lifted up and thou hast said I am a God I sit in the seat
of God in the midst of the seas yet thou art a man and not God
though thou set thine heart as the heart of God 283 Behold thou art
wiser than Daniel there is no secret that they can hide from thee
284 With thy wisdom and with thine understanding thou hast gotten
thee riches and hast gotten gold and silver into thy treasures 285
By thy great wisdom and by thy traffick hast thou increased thy
riches and thine heart is lifted up because of thy riches 286
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD Because thou hast set thine heart
as the heart of God 287 Behold therefore I will bring strangers
upon thee the terrible of the nations and they shall draw their
swords against the beauty of thy wisdom and they shall defile thy
brightness

288 They shall bring thee down to the pit and thou shalt die the
deaths of them that are slain in the midst of the seas

289 Wilt thou yet say before him that slayeth thee I am God but
thou shalt be a man and no God in the hand of him that slayeth thee

2810 Thou shalt die the deaths of the uncircumcised by the hand of
strangers for I have spoken it saith the Lord GOD

2811 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me saying 2812 Son of
man take up a lamentation upon the king of Tyrus and say unto him
Thus saith the Lord GOD Thou sealest up the sum full of wisdom and
perfect in beauty

2813 Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God every precious stone
was thy covering the sardius topaz and the diamond the beryl the
onyx and the jasper the sapphire the emerald and the carbuncle
and gold the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared
in thee in the day that thou wast created

2814 Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth and I have set thee
so thou wast upon the holy mountain of God thou hast walked up and
down in the midst of the stones of fire

2815 Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast
created till iniquity was found in thee

2816 By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst
of thee with violence and thou hast sinned therefore I will cast
thee as profane out of the mountain of God and I will destroy thee O
covering cherub from the midst of the stones of fire

2817 Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty thou hast
corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness I will cast thee to
the ground I will lay thee before kings that they may behold thee

2818 Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine
iniquities by the iniquity of thy traffick therefore will I bring
forth a fire from the midst of thee it shall devour thee and I will
bring thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that
behold thee

2819 All they that know thee among the people shall be astonished at
thee thou shalt be a terror and never shalt thou be any more
