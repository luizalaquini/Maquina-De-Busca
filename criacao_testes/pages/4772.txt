You won’t need last words I’m rescuing you Jaime’s voice was strangely solemn

Who said I required rescue

You know I’d almost forgotten what an annoying little man you are Now that you’ve reminded me I do believe I’ll let Cersei cut your head off after all

Oh no you won’t He waddled out of the cell Is it day or night up above I’ve lost all sense of time

Three hours past midnight The city sleeps Jaime slid the torch back into its sconce on the wall between the cells

The corridor was so poorly lit that Tyrion almost stumbled on the turnkey sprawled across the cold stone floor He prodded him with a toe Is he dead

Asleep The other three as well The eunuch dosed their wine with sweetsleep but not enough to kill them Or so he swears He is waiting back at the stair dressed up in a septon’s robe You’re going down into the sewers and from there to the river A galley is waiting in the bay Varys has agents in the Free Cities who will see that you do not lack for funds    but try not to be conspicuous Cersei will send men after you I have no doubt You might do well to take another name

Another name Oh certainly And when the Faceless Men come to kill me I’ll say ‘No you have the wrong man I’m a different dwarf with a hideous facial scar’ Both Lannisters laughed at the absurdity of it all Then Jaime went to one knee and kissed him quickly once on each cheek his lips brushing against the puckered ribbon of scar tissue

Thank you Brother Tyrion said For my life

It was    a debt I owed you Jaime’s voice was strange

A debt He cocked his head I do not understand

Good Some doors are best left closed

Oh dear said Tyrion Is there something grim and ugly behind it Could it be that someone said something cruel about me once I’ll try not to weep Tell me

Tyrion   

Jaime is afraid Tell me Tyrion said again

His brother looked away Tysha he said softly

Tysha His stomach tightened What of her

She was no whore I never bought her for you That was a lie that Father commanded me to tell Tysha was    she was what she seemed to be A crofter’s daughter chance met on the road

Tyrion could hear the faint sound of his own breath whistling hollowly through the scar of his nose Jaime could not meet his eyes Tysha He tried to remember what she had looked like A girl she was only a girl no older than Sansa My wife he croaked She wed me

For your gold Father said She was lowborn you were a Lannister of Casterly Rock All she wanted was the gold which made her no different from a whore so    so it would not be a lie not truly and    he said that you required a sharp lesson That you would learn from it and thank me later   

Thank you Tyrion’s voice was choked He gave her to his guards A barracks full of guards He made me    watch Aye and more than watch I took her too    my wife   

I never knew he would do that You must believe me

Oh must I Tyrion snarled Why should I believe you about anything ever She was my wife

Tyrion—

He hit him It was a slap backhanded but he put all his strength into it all his fear all his rage all his pain Jaime was squatting unbalanced The blow sent him tumbling backward to the floor I    I suppose I earned that

Oh you’ve earned more than that Jaime You and my sweet sister and our loving father yes I can’t begin to tell you what you’ve earned But you’ll have it that I swear to you A Lannister always pays his debts Tyrion waddled away almost stumbling over the turnkey again in his haste Before he had gone a dozen yards he bumped up against an iron gate that closed the passage Oh gods It was all he could do not to scream

Jaime came up behind him I have the gaoler’s keys

Then use them Tyrion stepped aside

Jaime unlocked the gate pushed it open and stepped through He looked back over his shoulder Are you coming

Not with you Tyrion stepped through Give me the keys and go I will find Varys on my own He cocked his head and stared up at his brother with his mismatched eyes Jaime can you fight left-handed

Rather less well than you Jaime said bitterly

Good Then we will be well matched if we should ever meet again The cripple and the dwarf

Jaime handed him the ring of keys I gave you the truth You owe me the same Did you do it Did you kill him

The question was another knife twisting in his guts Are you sure you want to know asked Tyrion Joffrey would have been a worse king than Aerys ever was He stole his father’s dagger and gave it to a footpad to slit the throat of Brandon Stark did you know that

I    I thought he might have

Well a son takes after his father Joff would have killed me as well once he came into his power For the crime of being short and ugly of which I am so conspicuously guilty

You have not answered my question

You poor stupid blind crippled fool Must I spell every little thing out for you Very well Cersei is a lying whore she’s been fucking Lancel and Osmund Kettleblack and probably Moon Boy for all I know And I am the monster they all say I am Yes I killed your vile son He made himself grin It must have been a hideous sight to see there in the torchlit gloom

Jaime turned without a word and walked away

Tyrion watched him go striding on his long strong legs and part of him wanted to call out to tell him that it wasn’t true to beg for his forgiveness But then he thought of Tysha and he held his silence He listened to the receding footsteps until he could hear them no longer then waddled off to look for Varys

The eunuch was lurking in the dark of a twisting turnpike stair garbed in a moth-eaten brown robe with a hood that hid the paleness of his face You were so long I feared that something had gone amiss he said when he saw Tyrion

Oh no Tyrion assured him in poisonous tones What could possibly have gone amiss He twisted his head back to stare up I sent for you during my trial

I could not come The queen had me watched night and day I dared not help you

You’re helping me now

Am I Ah Varys giggled It seemed strangely out of place in this place of cold stone and echoing darkness Your brother can be most persuasive

Varys you are as cold and slimy as a slug has anyone ever told you You did your best to kill me Perhaps I ought to return the favor

The eunuch sighed The faithful dog is kicked and no matter how the spider weaves he is never loved But if you slay me here I fear for you my lord You may never find your way back to daylight His eyes glittered in the shifting torchlight dark and wet These tunnels are full of traps for the unwary

Tyrion snorted Unwary I’m the wariest man who ever lived you helped see to that He rubbed at his nose So tell me wizard where is my innocent maiden wife

I have found no trace of Lady Sansa in King’s Landing sad to say Nor of Ser Dontos Hollard who by rights should have turned up somewhere drunk by now They were seen together on the serpentine steps the night she vanished After that nothing There was much confusion that night My little birds are silent Varys gave a gentle tug at the dwarf’s sleeve and pulled him into the stair My lord we must away Your path is down

That’s no lie at least Tyrion waddled along in the eunuch’s wake his heels scraping against the rough stone as they descended It was very cold within the stairwell a damp bone-chilling cold that set him to shivering at once What part of the dungeons are these he asked
