The best way was to start from the godswood shinny up the tall sentinel and cross over the armory and the guards hall leaping roof to roof barefoot so the guards wouldn’t hear you overhead That brought you up to the blind side of the First Keep the oldest part of the castle a squat round fortress that was taller than it looked Only rats and spiders lived there now but the old stones still made for good climbing You could go straight up to where the gargoyles leaned out blindly over empty space and swing from gargoyle to gargoyle hand over hand around to the north side From there if you really stretched you could reach out and pull yourself over to the broken tower where it leaned close The last part was the scramble up the blackened stones to the eyrie no more than ten feet and then the crows would come round to see if you’d brought any corn

Bran was moving from gargoyle to gargoyle with the ease of long practice when he heard the voices He was so startled he almost lost his grip The First Keep had been empty all his life

I do not like it a woman was saying There was a row of windows beneath him and the voice was drifting out of the last window on this side You should be the Hand

Gods forbid a man’s voice replied lazily It’s not an honor I’d want There’s far too much work involved

Bran hung listening suddenly afraid to go on They might glimpse his feet if he tried to swing by

Don’t you see the danger this puts us in the woman said Robert loves the man like a brother

Robert can barely stomach his brothers Not that I blame him Stannis would be enough to give anyone indigestion

Don’t play the fool Stannis and Renly are one thing and Eddard Stark is quite another Robert will listen to Stark Damn them both I should have insisted that he name you but I was certain Stark would refuse him

We ought to count ourselves fortunate the man said The king might as easily have named one of his brothers or even Littlefinger gods help us Give me honorable enemies rather than ambitious ones and I’ll sleep more easily by night

They were talking about Father Bran realized He wanted to hear more A few more feet… but they would see him if he swung out in front of the window

We will have to watch him carefully the woman said

I would sooner watch you the man said He sounded bored Come back here

Lord Eddard has never taken any interest in anything that happened south of the Neck the woman said Never I tell you he means to move against us Why else would he leave the seat of his power

A hundred reasons Duty Honor He yearns to write his name large across the book of history to get away from his wife or both Perhaps he just wants to be warm for once in his life

His wife is Lady Arryn’s sister It’s a wonder Lysa was not here to greet us with her accusations

Bran looked down There was a narrow ledge beneath the window only a few inches wide He tried to lower himself toward it Too far He would never reach

You fret too much Lysa Arryn is a frightened cow

That frightened cow shared Jon Arryn’s bed

If she knew anything she would have gone to Robert before she fled King’s Landing

When he had already agreed to foster that weakling son of hers at Casterly Rock I think not She knew the boy’s life would be hostage to her silence She may grow bolder now that he’s safe atop the Eyrie

Mothers The man made the word sound like a curse I think birthing does something to your minds You are all mad He laughed It was a bitter sound Let Lady Arryn grow as bold as she likes Whatever she knows whatever she thinks she knows she has no proof He paused a moment Or does she

Do you think the king will require proof the woman said I tell you he loves me not

And whose fault is that sweet sister

Bran studied the ledge He could drop down It was too narrow to land on but if he could catch hold as he fell past pull himself up… except that might make a noise draw them to the window He was not sure what he was hearing but he knew it was not meant for his ears

You are as blind as Robert the woman was saying

If you mean I see the same thing yes the man said I see a man who would sooner die than betray his king

He betrayed one already or have you forgotten the woman said Oh I don’t deny he’s loyal to Robert that’s obvious What happens when Robert dies and Joff takes the throne And the sooner that comes to pass the safer we’ll all be My husband grows more restless every day Having Stark beside him will only make him worse He’s still in love with the sister the insipid little dead sixteen-year-old How long till he decides to put me aside for some new Lyanna

Bran was suddenly very frightened He wanted nothing so much as to go back the way he had come to find his brothers Only what would he tell them He had to get closer Bran realized He had to see who was talking

The man sighed You should think less about the future and more about the pleasures at hand

Stop that the woman said Bran heard the sudden slap of flesh on flesh then the man’s laughter

Bran pulled himself up climbed over the gargoyle crawled out onto the roof This was the easy way He moved across the roof to the next gargoyle right above the window of the room where they were talking

All this talk is getting very tiresome sister the man said Come here and be quiet

Bran sat astride the gargoyle tightened his legs around it and swung himself around upside down He hung by his legs and slowly stretched his head down toward the window The world looked strange upside down A courtyard swam dizzily below him its stones still wet with melted snow

Bran looked in the window

Inside the room a man and a woman were wrestling They were both naked Bran could not tell who they were The man’s back was to him and his body screened the woman from view as he pushed her up against a wall

There were soft wet sounds Bran realized they were kissing He watched wide-eyed and frightened his breath tight in his throat The man had a hand down between her legs and he must have been hurting her there because the woman started to moan low in her throat Stop it she said stop it stop it Oh please… But her voice was low and weak and she did not push him away Her hands buried themselves in his hair his tangled golden hair and pulled his face down to her breast

Bran saw her face Her eyes were closed and her mouth was open moaning Her golden hair swung from side to side as her head moved back and forth but still he recognized the queen

He must have made a noise Suddenly her eyes opened and she was staring right at him She screamed

Everything happened at once then ‘ The woman pushed the man away wildly shouting and pointing Bran tried to pull himself up bending double as he reached for the gargoyle He was in too much of a hurry His hand scraped uselessly across smooth stone and in his panic his legs slipped and suddenly he was failing There was an instant of vertigo a sickening lurch as the window flashed past He shot out a hand grabbed for the ledge lost it caught it again with his other hand He swung against the building hard The impact took the breath out of him Bran dangled one-handed panting

Faces appeared in the window above him

The queen And now Bran recognized the man beside her They looked as much alike as reflections in a mirror

He saw us the woman said shrilly

So he did the man said

Bran’s fingers started to slip He grabbed the ledge with his other hand Fingernails dug into unyielding stone The man reached down Take my hand he said Before you fall

Bran seized his arm and held on tight with all his strength The man yanked him up to the ledge What are you doing the woman demanded

The man ignored her He was very strong He stood Bran up on the sill How old are you boy

Seven Bran said shaking with relief His fingers had dug deep gouges in the man’s forearm He let go sheepishly

The man looked over at the woman The things I do for love he said with loathing He gave Bran a shove

Screaming Bran went backward out the window into empty air There was nothing to grab on to The courtyard rushed up to meet him

Somewhere off in the distance a wolf was howling Crows circled the broken tower waiting for corn
