The old knight drew himself up straight I offer myself in my daughter’s place Release her and take me as your hostage Surely the castellan of Winterfell is worth more than a child

Not to me A valiant gesture old man but I am not that great a fool Not to Lord Manderly or Leobald Tallhart either I’d wager Your sorry old skin is worth no more to them than any other man’s No I’ll keep the girl… and keep her safe so long as you do as I’ve commanded you Her life is in your hands

Gods be good Theon how can you do this You know I must attack have sworn…

If this host is still in arms before my gate when the sun sets Beth will hang said Theon Another hostage will follow her to the grave at first light and another at sunset Every dawn and every dusk will mean a death until you are gone I have no lack of hostages He did not wait for a reply but wheeled Smiler around and rode back toward the castle He went slowly at first but the thought of those archers at his back soon drove him to a canter The small heads watched him come from their spikes their tarred and flayed faces looming larger with every yard between them stood little Beth Cassel noosed and crying Theon put his heel into Smiler and broke into a hard gallop Smiler’s hooves clattered on the drawbridge like drumbeats

In the yard he dismounted and handed his reins to Wex It may stay them he told Black Lorren We’ll know by sunset Take the girl in till then and keep her somewhere safe Under the layers of leather steel and wool he was slick with sweat I need a cup of wine A vat of wine would do even better

A fire had been laid in Ned Stark’s bedchamber Theon sat beside it and filled a cup with a heavy-bodied red from the castle vaults a wine as sour as his mood They will attack he thought gloomily staring at the flames Ser Rodrik loves his daughter but he is still castellan and most of all a knight Had it been Theon with a noose around his neck and Lord Balon commanding the army without the warhorns would already have sounded the attack he had no doubt He should thank the gods that Ser Rodrik was not ironborn The men of the green lands were made of softer stuff though he was not certain they would prove soft enough

If not if the old man gave the command to storm the castle regardless Winterfell would fall Theon entertained no delusions on that count His seventeen might kill three four five times their own number but in the end they would be overwhelmed

Theon stared at the flames over the rim of his wine goblet brooding on the injustice of it all I rode beside Robb Stark in the Whispering Wood he muttered He had been frightened that night but not like this It was one thing to go into battle surrounded by friends and another to perish alone and despised Mercy he thought miserably

When the wine brought no solace Theon sent Wex to fetch his bow and took himself to the old inner ward There he stood loosing shaft after shaft at the archery butts until his shoulders ached and his fingers were bloody pausing only long enough to pull the arrows from the targets for another round I saved Bran’s life with this bow he reminded himself Would that I could save my own Women came to the well but did not linger whatever they saw on Theon’s face sent them away quickly

Behind him the broken tower stood its summit as jagged as a crown where fire had collapsed the upper stories long ago As the sun moved the shadow of the tower moved as well gradually lengthening a black arm reaching out for Theon Greyjoy By the time the sun touched the wall he was in its grasp If I hang the girl the northmen will attack at once he thought as he loosed a shaft If I do not hang her they will know my threats are empty He knocked another arrow to his bow There is no way out none

If you had a hundred archers as good as yourself you might have a chance to hold the castle a voice said softly

When he turned Maester Luwin was behind him Go away Theon told him I have had enough of your counsel

And life Have you had enough of that my lord prince

He raised the bow One more word and I’ll put this shaft through your heart

You won’t

Theon bent the bow drawing the grey goose feathers back to his cheek Care to make a wager

I am your last hope Theon

I have no hope he thought Yet he lowered the bow half an inch and said I will not run

I do not speak of running Take the black

The Night’s Watch Theon let the bow unbend slowly and pointed the arrow at the ground

Ser Rodrik has served House Stark all his life and House Stark has always been a friend to the Watch He will not deny you Open your gates lay down your arms accept his terms and he must let you take the black

A brother of the Night’s Watch It meant no crown no sons no wife… but it meant life and life with honor Ned Stark’s own brother had chosen the Watch and Jon Snow as well

I have black garb aplenty once I tear the krakens off Even my horse is black I could rise high in the Watch—chief of rangers likely even Lord Commander Let Asha keep the bloody islands they’re as dreary as she is If I served at Eastwatch I could command my own ship and there’s fine hunting beyond the Wall As for women what wildling woman wouldn’t want a prince in her bed A slow smile crept across his face A black cloak can’t be turned I’d be as good as any man…

PRINCE THEON The sudden shout shattered his daydream Kromm was loping across the ward The northmen—

He felt a sudden sick sense of dread Is it the attack

Maester Luwin clutched his arm There’s still time Raise a peace banner—

They’re fighting Kromm said urgently More men came up hundreds of them and at first they made to join the others But now they’ve fallen on them

Is it Asha Had she come to save him after all

But Kromm gave a shake of his head No These are northmen I tell you With a bloody man on their banner

The flayed man of the Dreadfort Reek had belonged to the Bastard of Bolton before his capture Theon recalled It was hard to believe that a vile creature like him could sway the Boltons to change their allegiance but nothing else made sense I’ll see this for myself Theon said

Maester Luwin trailed after him By the time they reached the battlements dead men and dying horses were strewn about the market square outside the gates He saw no battle lines only a swirling chaos of banners and blades Shouts and screams rang through the cold autumn air Ser Rodrik seemed to have the numbers but the Dreadfort men were better led and had taken the others unawares Theon watched them charge and wheel and charge again chopping the larger force to bloody pieces every time they tried to form up between the houses He could hear the crash of iron axeheads on oaken shields over the terrified trumpeting of a maimed horse The inn was burning he saw

Black Lorren appeared beside him and stood silently for a time The sun was low in the west painting the fields and houses all a glowing red A thin wavering cry of pain drifted over the walls and a warhorn sounded off beyond the burning houses Theon watched a wounded man drag himself painfully across the ground smearing his life’s blood in the dirt as he struggled to reach the well that stood at the center of the market square He died before he got there He wore a leather jerkin and conical halfhelm but no badge to tell which side he’d fought on

The crows came in the blue dust with the evening stars The Dothraki believe the stars are spirits of the valiant dead Theon said Maester Luwin had told him that a long time ago

Dothraki

The horselords across the narrow sea

Oh Them Black Lorren frowned through his beard Savages believe all manner of foolish things

As the night grew darker and the smoke spread it was harder to make out what was happening below but the din of steel gradually diminished to nothing and the shouts and warhorns gave way to moans and piteous wailing Finally a column of mounted men rode out of the drifting smoke At their head was a knight in dark armor His rounded helm gleamed a sullen red and a pale pink cloak streamed from his shoulders Outside the main gate he reined up and one of his men shouted for the castle to open

Are you friend or foe Black Lorren bellowed down

Would a foe bring such fine gifts Red Helm waved a hand and three corpses were dumped in front of the gates A torch was waved above the bodies so the defenders upon the walls might see the faces of the dead

The old castellan said Black Lorren

With Leobald Tallhart and Cley Cerwyn The boy lord had taken an arrow in the eye and Ser Rodrik had lost his left arm at the elbow Maester Luwin gave a wordless cry of dismay turned away from the battlements and fell to his knees sick

The great pig Manderly was too craven to leave White Harbor or we would have brought him as well shouted Red Helm

I am saved Theon thought So why did he feel so empty This was victory sweet victory the deliverance he had prayed for He glanced at Maester Luwin To think how close I came to yielding and taking the black…

Open the gates for our friends Perhaps tonight Theon would sleep without fear of what his dreams might bring

The Dreadfort men made their way across the moat and through the inner gates Theon descended with Black Lorren and Maester Luwin to meet them in the yard Pale red pennons trailed from the ends of a few lances but many more carried battle-axes and greatswords and shields hacked half to splinters How many men did you lose Theon asked Red Helm as he dismounted

Twenty or thirty The torchlight glittered off the chipped enamel of his visor His helm and gorget were wrought in the shape of a man’s face and shoulders skinless and bloody mouth open in a silent howl of anguish

Ser Rodrik had you five-to-one

Aye but he thought us friends A common mistake When the old fool gave me his hand I took half his arm instead Then I let him see my face The man put both hands to his helm and lifted it off his head holding it in the crook of his arm

Reek Theon said disquieted How did a serving man get such fine armor

The man laughed The wretch is dead He stepped closer The girl’s fault If she had not run so far his horse would not have lamed and we might have been able to flee I gave him mine when I saw the riders from the ridge I was done with her by then and he liked to take his turn while they were still warm I had to pull him off her and shove my clothes into his hands—calfskin boots and velvet doublet silver-chased swordbelt even my sable cloak Ride for the Dreadfort I told him bring all the help you can Take my horse he’s swifter and here wear the ring my father gave me so they’ll know you came from me He’d learned better than to question me By the time they put that arrow through his back I’d smeared myself with the girl’s filth and dressed in his rags They might have hanged me anyway but it was the only chance I saw He rubbed the back of his hand across his mouth And now my sweet prince there was a woman promised me if I brought two hundred men Well I brought three times as many and no green boys nor fieldhands neither but my father’s own garrison
