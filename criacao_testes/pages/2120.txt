The Old Bear’s not like to give you a choice

Might be we won’t give him one said Chett

Just then one of the dogs had raised his head and growled and he had to move away quickly before he was seen I was not meant to hear that he thought He considered taking the tale to Mormont but he could not bring himself to inform on his brothers even brothers such as Chett and the Sisterman It was just empty talk he told himself They are cold and afraid we all are It was hard waiting here perched on the stony summit above the forest wondering what the morrow might bring The unseen enemy is always the most fearsome

Jon slid his new dagger from its sheath and studied the flames as they played against the shiny black glass He had fashioned the wooden hilt himself and wound hempen twine around it to make a grip Ugly but it served Dolorous Edd opined that glass knives were about as useful as nipples on a knight’s breastplate but Jon was not so certain The dragonglass blade was sharper than steel albeit far more brittle

It must have been buried for a reason

He had made a dagger for Grenn as well and another for the Lord Commander The warhorn he had given to Sam On closer examination the horn had proved cracked and even after he had cleaned all the dirt out Jon had been unable to get any sound from it The rim was chipped as well but Sam liked old things even worthless old things Make a drinking horn out of it Jon told him and every time you take a drink you’ll remember how you ranged beyond the Wall all the way to the Fist of the First Men He gave Sam a spearhead and a dozen arrowheads as well and passed the rest out among his other friends for luck

The Old Bear had seemed pleased by the dagger but he preferred a steel knife at his belt Jon had noticed Mormont could offer no answers as to who might have buried the cloak or what it might mean Perhaps Qhorin will know The Halfhand had ventured deeper into the wild than any other living man

You want to serve or shall I

Jon sheathed the dagger I’ll do it He wanted to hear what they were saying

Edd cut three thick slices off a stale round of oat bread stacked them on a wooden platter covered them with bacon and bacon drippings and filled a bowl with hard-cooked eggs Jon took the bowl in one hand and the platter in the other and backed into the Lord Commander’s tent

Qhorin was seated cross-legged on the floor his spine as straight as a spear Candlelight flickered against the hard flat planes of his cheeks as he spoke    Rattleshirt the Weeping Man and every other chief great and small he was saying They have wargs as well and mammoths and more strength than we would have dreamed Or so he claimed I will not swear as to the truth of it Ebben believes the man was telling us tales to make his life last a little longer

True or false the Wall must be warned the Old Bear said as Jon placed the platter between them And the king

Which king

All of them The true and the false alike If they would claim the realm let them defend it

The Halfhand helped himself to an egg and cracked it on the edge of the bowl These kings will do what they will he said peeling away the shell Likely it will be little enough The best hope is Winterfell The Starks must rally the north

Yes To be sure The Old Bear unrolled a map frowned at it tossed it aside opened another He was pondering where the hammer would fall Jon could see it The Watch had once manned seventeen castles along the hundred leagues of the Wall but they had been abandoned one by one as the brotherhood dwindled Only three were now garrisoned a fact that Mance Rayder knew as well as they did Ser Alliser Thorne will bring back fresh levies from King’s Landing we can hope If we man Greyguard from the Shadow Tower and the Long Barrow from Eastwatch   

Greyguard has largely collapsed Stonedoor would serve better if the men could be found Icemark and Deep Lake as well mayhaps With daily patrols along the battlements between

Patrols aye Twice a day if we can The Wall itself is a formidable obstacle Undefended it cannot stop them yet it will delay them The larger the host the longer they’ll require From the emptiness they’ve left behind they must mean to bring their women with them Their young as well and beasts    have you ever seen a goat climb a ladder A rope They will need to build a stair or a great ramp    it will take a moon’s turn at the least perhaps longer Mance will know his best chance is to pass beneath the Wall Through a gate or   

A breach

Mormont’s head came up sharply What

They do not plan to climb the Wall nor to burrow beneath it my lord They plan to break it

The Wall is seven hundred feet high and so thick at the base that it would take a hundred men a year to cut through it with picks and axes

Even so

Mormont plucked at his beard frowning How

How else Sorcery Qhorin bit the egg in half Why else would Mance choose to gather his strength in the Frostfangs Bleak and hard they are and a long weary march from the Wall

I’d hoped he chose the mountains to hide his muster from the eyes of my rangers

Perhaps said Qhorin finishing the egg but there is more I think He is seeking something in the high cold places He is searching for something he needs

Something Mormont’s raven lifted its head and screamed The sound was sharp as a knife in the closeness of the tent

Some power What it is our captive could not say He was questioned perhaps too sharply and died with much unsaid I doubt he knew in any case

Jon could hear the wind outside It made a high thin sound as it shivered through the stones of the ringwall and tugged at the tent ropes Mormont rubbed his mouth thoughtfully Some power he repeated I must know

Then you must send scouts into the mountains

I am loath to risk more men

We can only die Why else do we don these black cloaks but to die in defense of the realm I would send fifteen men in three parties of five One to probe the Milkwater one the Skirling Pass one to climb the Giant’s Stair Jarman Buckwell Thoren Smallwood and myself to command To learn what waits in those mountains

Waits the raven cried Waits

Lord Commander Mormont sighed deep in his chest I see no other choice he conceded but if you do not return   

Someone will come down out of the Frostfangs my lord the ranger said If us all well and good If not it will be Mance Rayder and you sit square in his path He cannot march south and leave you behind to follow and harry his rear He must attack This is a strong place

Not that strong said Mormont

Belike we shall all die then Our dying will buy time for our brothers on the Wall Time to garrison the empty castles and freeze shut the gates time to summon lords and kings to their aid time to hone their axes and repair their catapults Our lives will be coin well spent

Die the raven muttered pacing along Mormont’s shoulders Die die die die The Old Bear sat slumped and silent as if the burden of speech had grown too heavy for him to bear But at last he said May the gods forgive me Choose your men

Qhorin Halfhand turned his head His eyes met Jon’s and held them for a long moment Very well I choose Jon Snow

Mormont blinked He is hardly more than a boy And my steward besides Not even a ranger

Tollett can care for you as well my lord Qhorin lifted his maimed two-fingered hand The old gods are still strong beyond the Wall The gods of the First Men    and the Starks

Mormont looked at Jon What is your will in this

To go he said at once

The old man smiled sadly I thought it might be

Dawn had broken when Jon stepped from the tent beside Qhorin Halfhand The wind swirled around them stirring their black cloaks and sending a scatter of red cinders flying from the fire

We ride at noon the ranger told him Best find that wolf of yours
