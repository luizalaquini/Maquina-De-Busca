Curse the man His uncle Kevan sounded more angry than surprised I warned Jaime not to trust that one A man who fights for coin is loyal only to his purse

Lord Tywin wove his fingers together under his chin Only his eyes moved as he listened His bristling golden side-whiskers framed a face so still it might have been a mask but Tyrion could see tiny beads of sweat dappling his father’s shaven head

How could it happen Ser Harys Swyft wailed again Ser Jaime taken the siege broken… this is a catastrophe

Ser Addam Marbrand said I am sure we are all grateful to you for pointing out the obvious Ser Harys The question is what shall we do about it

What can we do Jaime’s host is all slaughtered or taken or put to flight and the Starks and the Tullys sit squarely across our line of supply We are cut off from the west They can march on Casterly Rock if they so choose and what’s to stop them My lords we are beaten We must sue for peace

Peace Tyrion swirled his wine thoughtfully took a deep draft and hurled his empty cup to the floor where it shattered into a thousand pieces There’s your peace Ser Harys My sweet nephew broke it for good and all when he decided to ornament the Red Keep with Lord Eddard’s head You’ll have an easier time drinking wine from that cup than you will convincing Robb Stark to make peace now He’s winning… or hadn’t you noticed

Two battles do not make a war Ser Addam insisted We are far from lost I should welcome the chance to try my own steel against this Stark boy

Perhaps they would consent to a truce and allow us to trade our prisoners for theirs offered Lord Lefford

Unless they trade three-for-one we still come out light on those scales Tyrion said acidly And what are we to offer for my brother Lord Eddard’s rotting head

I had heard that Queen Cersei has the Hand’s daughters Lefford said hopefully If we give the lad his sisters back…

Ser Addam snorted disdainfully He would have to be an utter ass to trade Jaime Lannister’s life for two girls

Then we must ransom Ser Jaime whatever it costs Lord Lefford said

Tyrion rolled his eyes If the Starks feel the need for gold they can melt down Jaime’s armor

if we ask for a truce they will think us weak Ser Addarn argued We should march on them at once

Surely our friends at court could be prevailed upon to join us with fresh troops said Ser Harys And someone might return to Casterly Rock to raise a new host

Lord Tywin Lannister rose to his feet They have my son he said once more in a voice that cut through the babble like a sword through suet Leave me All of you

Ever the soul of obedience Tyrion rose to depart with the rest but his father gave him a look Not you Tyrion Remain And you as well Kevan The rest of you out

Tyrion eased himself back onto the bench startled into speechlessness Ser Kevan crossed the room to the wine casks Uncle Tyrion called if you would be so kind—

Here His father offered him his cup the wine untouched

Now Tyrion truly was nonplussed He drank

Lord Tywin seated himself You have the right of it about Stark Alive we might have used Lord Eddard to forge a peace with Winterfell and Riverrun a peace that would have given us the time we need to deal with Robert’s brothers Dead… His hand curled into a fist Madness Rank madness

Joff’s only a boy Tyrion pointed out At his age I committed a few follies of my own

His father gave him a sharp look I suppose we ought to be grateful that he has not yet married a whore

Tyrion sipped at his wine wondering how Lord Tywin would look if he flung the cup in his face

Our position is worse than you know his father went on It would seem we have a new king

Ser Kevan looked poleaxed A new—who What have they done to Joffrey

The faintest flicker of distaste played across Lord Tywin’s thin lips Nothing… yet My grandson still sits the Iron Throne but the eunuch has heard whispers from the south Renly Baratheon wed Margaery Tyrell at Highgarden this fortnight past and now he has claimed the crown The bride’s father and brothers have bent the knee and sworn him their swords

Those are grave tidings When Ser Kevan frowned the furrows in his brow grew deep as canyons

My daughter commands us to ride for King’s Landing at once to defend the Red Keep against King Renly and the Knight of Flowers His mouth tightened Commands us mind you In the name of the king and council

How is King Joffrey taking the news Tyrion asked with a certain black amusement

Cersei has not seen fit to tell him yet Lord Tywin said She fears he might insist on marching against Renly himself

With what army Tyrion asked You don’t plan to give him this one I hope

He talks of leading the City Watch Lord Tywin said

If he takes the Watch he’ll leave the city undefended Ser Kevan said And with Lord Stannis on Dragonstone…

Yes Lord Tywin looked down at his son I had thought you were the one made for motley Tyrion but it would appear that I was wrong

Why Father said Tyrion that almost sounds like praise He leaned forward intently What of Stannis He’s the elder not Renly How does he feel about his brother’s claim

His father frowned I have felt from the beginning that Stannis was a greater danger than all the others combined Yet he does nothing Oh Varys hears his whispers Stannis is building ships Stannis is hiring sellswords Stannis is bringing a shadowbinder from Asshai What does it mean Is any of it true He gave an irritated shrug Kevan bring us the map

Ser Kevan did as he was bid Lord Tywin unrolled the leather smoothing it flat Jaime has left us in a bad way Roose Bolton and the remnants of his host are north of us Our enemies hold the Twins and Moat Cailin Robb Stark sits to the west so we cannot retreat to Lannisport and the Rock unless we choose to give battle Jaime is taken and his army for all purposes has ceased to exist Thoros of Myr and Beric Dondarrion continue to plague our foraging parties To our east we have the Arryns Stannis Baratheon sits on Dragonstone and in the south Highgarden and Storm’s End are calling their banners

Tyrion smiled crookedly Take heart Father At least Rhaegar Targaryen is still dead

I had hoped you might have more to offer us than japes Tyrion Lord Tywin Lannister said

Ser Kevan frowned over the map forehead creasing Robb Stark will have Edmure Tully and the lords of the Trident with him now Their combined power may exceed our own And with Roose Bolton behind us… Tywin if we remain here I fear we might be caught between three armies

I have no intention of remaining here We must finish our business with young Lord Stark before Renly Baratheon can march from Highgarden Bolton does not concern me He is a wary man and we made him warier on the Green Fork He will be slow to give pursuit So… on the morrow we make for Harrenhal Kevan I want Ser Addam’s outriders to screen our movements Give him as many men as he requires and send them out in groups of four I will have no vanishings

As you say my lord but… why Harrenhal That is a grim unlucky place Some call it cursed

Let them Lord Tywin said Unleash Ser Gregor and send him before us with his reavers Send forth Vargo Hoat and his freeriders as well and Ser Amory Lorch Each is to have three hundred horse Tell them I want to see the riverlands afire from the Gods Eye to the Red Fork

They will burn my lord Ser Kevan said rising I shall give the commands He bowed and made for the door

When they were alone Lord Tywin glanced at Tyrion Your savages might relish a bit of rapine Tell them they may ride with Vargo Hoat and plunder as they like—goods stock women they may take what they want and burn the rest

Telling Shagga and Timett how to pillage is like telling a rooster how to crow Tyrion commented but I should prefer to keep them with me Uncouth and unruly they might be yet the wildlings were his and he trusted them more than any of his father’s men He was not about to hand them over

Then you had best learn to control them I will not have the city plundered

The city Tyrion was lost What city would that be

King’s Landing I am sending you to court
