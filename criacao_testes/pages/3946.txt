her anyway because his corpse called out for her to flee
Thats weird obviously the talking-corpse bit but its not
until the third verse that The Hanging Tree begins to get
unnerving You realize the singer of the song is the dead
murderer Hes still in the hanging tree And even though he
told his lover to flee he keeps asking if shes coming to
meet him The phrase Where I told you to run so wed both
be free is the most troubling because at first you think hes
talking about when he told her to flee presumably to safety
But then you wonder if he meant for her to run to him To
death In the final stanza its clear that thats what hes
waiting for His lover with her rope necklace hanging dead
next to him in the tree
I used to think the murderer was the creepiest guy
imaginable Now with a couple of trips to the Hunger
Games under my belt I decide not to judge him without
knowing more details Maybe his lover was already
sentenced to death and he was trying to make it easier To
let her know hed be waiting Or maybe he thought the place
he was leaving her was really worse than death Didnt I
want to kill Peeta with that syringe to save him from the
Capitol Was that really my only option Probably not but I
couldnt think of another at the time
I guess my mother thought the whole thing was too
twisted for a seven-year-old though Especially one who
made her own rope necklaces It wasnt like hanging was
something that only happened in a story Plenty of people
were executed that way in 12 You can bet she didnt want
me singing it in front of my music class She probably
wouldnt like me doing it here for Pollux even but at least
Im not--wait no Im wrong As I glance sideways I see
Castor has been taping me Everyone is watching me
intently And Pollux has tears running down his cheeks
because no doubt my freaky song has dredged up some
terrible incident in his life Great I sigh and lean back
against the trunk Thats when the mockingjays begin their
rendition of The Hanging Tree In their mouths its quite
beautiful Conscious of being filmed I stand quietly until I
hear Cressida call Cut
Plutarch crosses to me laughing Where do you
come up with this stuff No one would believe it if we made
it up He throws an arm around me and kisses me on the
top of my head with a loud smack Youre golden
I wasnt doing it for the cameras I say
Lucky they were on then he says Come on
everybody back to town
As we trudge back through the woods we reach a
boulder and both Gale and I turn our heads in the same
direction like a pair of dogs catching a scent on the wind
Cressida notices and asks what lies that way We admit
without acknowledging each other its our old hunting
rendezvous place She wants to see it even after we tell
her its nothing really
Nothing but a place where I was happy I think
Our rock ledge overlooking the valley Perhaps a little
less green than usual but the blackberry bushes hang
heavy with fruit Here began countless days of hunting and
snaring fishing and gathering roaming together through
the woods unloading our thoughts while we filled our game
bags This was the doorway to both sustenance and sanity
And we were each others key
Theres no District 12 to escape from now no
Peacekeepers to trick no hungry mouths to feed The
Capitol took away all of that and Im on the verge of losing
Gale as well The glue of mutual need that bonded us so
tightly together for all those years is melting away Dark
patches not light show in the spaces between us How can
it be that today in the face of 12s horrible demise we are
too angry to even speak to each other
Gale as good as lied to me That was unacceptable
even if he was concerned about my well-being His apology
seemed genuine though And I threw it back in his face
with an insult to make sure it stung What is happening to
us Why are we always at odds now Its all a muddle but I
somehow feel that if I went back to the root of our troubles
my actions would be at the heart of it Do I really want to
drive him away
My fingers encircle a blackberry and pluck it from its
stem I roll it gently between my thumb and forefinger
Suddenly I turn to him and toss it in his direction And may
the odds-- I say I throw it high so he has plenty of time to
decide whether to knock it aside or accept it
Gales eyes train on me not the berry but at the last
moment he opens his mouth and catches it He chews
swallows and theres a long pause before he says --be
ever in your favor But he does say it
Cressida has us sit in the nook in the rocks where its
impossible not to be touching and coaxes us into talking
about hunting What drove us out into the woods how we
met favorite moments We thaw begin to laugh a little as
we relate mishaps with bees and wild dogs and skunks
When the conversation turns to how it felt to translate our
skill with weapons to the bombing in 8 I stop talking Gale
just says Long overdue
By the time we reach the town square afternoons
sinking into evening I take Cressida to the rubble of the
bakery and ask her to film something The only emotion I
can muster is exhaustion Peeta this is your home None
of your family has been heard of since the bombing Twelve
is gone And youre calling for a cease-fire I look across
