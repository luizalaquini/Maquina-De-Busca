The Tower of Ghosts was the most ruinous of Harrenhal’s five immense towers It stood dark and desolate behind the remains of a collapsed sept where only rats had come to pray for near three hundred years It was there she waited to see if Gendry and Hot Pie would come It seemed as though she waited a long time The horses nibbled at the weeds that grew up between the broken stones while the clouds swallowed the last of the stars Arya took out the dagger and sharpened it to keep her hands busy Long smooth strokes the way Syrio had taught her The sound calmed her

She heard them coming long before she saw them Hot Pie was breathing heavily and once he stumbled in the dark barked his shin and cursed loud enough to wake half of Harrenhal Gendry was quieter but the swords he was carrying rang together as he moved Here I am She stood Be quiet or they’ll hear you

The boys picked their way toward her over tumbled stones Gendry was wearing oiled chainmail under his cloak she saw and he had his blacksmith’s hammer slung across his back Hot Pie’s red round face peered out from under a hood He had a sack of bread dangling from his right hand and a big wheel of cheese under his left arm There’s a guard on that postern said Gendry quietly I told you there would be

You stay here with the horses said Arya I’ll get rid of him Come quick when I call

Gendry nodded Hot Pie said Hoot like an owl when you want us to come

I’m not an owl said Arya I’m a wolf I’ll howl

Alone she slid through the shadow of the Tower of Ghosts She walked fast to keep ahead of her fear and it felt as though Syrio Forel walked beside her and Yoren and Jaqen H’ghar and Jon Snow She had not taken the sword Gendry had brought her not yet For this the dagger would be better It was good and sharp This postern was the least of Harrenhal’s gates a narrow door of stout oak studded with iron nails set in an angle of the wall beneath a defensive tower Only one man was set to guard it but she knew there would be sentries up in that tower as well and others nearby walking the walls Whatever happened she must be quiet as a shadow He must not call out A few scattered raindrops had begun to fall She felt one land on her brow and run slowly down her nose

She made no effort to hide but approached the guard openly as if Lord Bolton himself had sent her He watched her come curious as to what might bring a page here at this black hour When she got closer she saw that he was a northman very tall and thin huddled in a ragged fur cloak That was bad She might have been able to trick a Frey or one of the Brave Companions but the Dreadfort men had served Roose Bolton their whole life and they knew him better than she did If I tell him I am Arya Stark and command him to stand aside… No she dare not He was a northman but not a Winterfell man He belonged to Roose Bolton

When she reached him she pushed back her cloak so he would see the flayed man on her breast Lord Bolton sent me

At this hour Why for

She could see the gleam of steel under the fur and she did not know if she was strong enough to drive the point of the dagger through chainmail His throat it must be his throat but he’s too tall I’ll never reach it For a moment she did not know what to say For a moment she was a little girl again and scared and the rain on her face felt like tears

He told me to give all his guards a silver piece for their good service The words seemed to come out of nowhere

Silver you say He did not believe her but he wanted to silver was silver after all Give it over then

Her fingers dug down beneath her tunic and came out clutching the coin Jaqen had given her In the dark the iron could pass for tarnished silver She held it out… and let it slip through her fingers

Cursing her softly the man went to a knee to grope for the coin in the dirt and there was his neck right in front of her Arya slid her dagger out and drew it across his throat as smooth as summer silk His blood covered her hands in a hot gush and he tried to shout but there was blood in his mouth as well

Valar morghulis she whispered as he died

When he stopped moving she picked up the coin Outside the walls of Harrenhal a wolf howled long and loud She lifted the bar set it aside and pulled open the heavy oak door By the time Hot Pie and Gendry came up with the horses the rain was falling hard You killed him Hot Pie gasped

What did you think I would do Her fingers were sticky with blood and the smell was making her mare skittish It’s no matter she thought swinging up into the saddle The rain will wash them clean again





SANSA

The throne room was a sea of jewels furs and bright fabrics Lords and ladies filled the back of the hall and stood beneath the high windows jostling like fishwives on a dock

The denizens of Joffrey’s court had striven to outdo each other today Jalabhar Xho was all in feathers a plumage so fantastic and extravagant that he seemed like to take flight The High Septon’s crystal crown fired rainbows through the air every time he moved his head At the council table Queen Cersei shimmered in a cloth-of-gold gown slashed in burgundy velvet while beside her Varys fussed and simpered in a lilac brocade Moon Boy and Ser Dontos wore new suits of motley clean as a spring morning Even Lady Tanda and her daughters looked pretty in matching gowns of turquoise silk and vair and Lord Gyles was coughing into a square of scarlet silk trimmed with golden lace King Joffrey sat above them all amongst the blades and barbs of the Iron Throne He was in crimson samite his black mantle studded with rubies on his head his heavy golden crown

Squirming through a press of knights squires and rich townfolk Sansa reached the front of the gallery just as a blast of trumpets announced the entry of Lord Tywin Lannister

He rode his warhorse down the length of the hall and dismounted before the Iron Throne Sansa had never seen such armor all burnished red steel inlaid with golden scrollwork and ornamentation His rondels were sunbursts the roaring lion that crowned his helm had ruby eyes and a lioness on each shoulder fastened a cloth-of-gold cloak so long and heavy that it draped the hindquarters of his charger Even the horse’s armor was gilded and his bardings were shimmering crimson silk emblazoned with the lion of Lannister

The Lord of Casterly Rock made such an impressive figure that it was a shock when his destrier dropped a load of dung right at the base of the throne Joffrey had to step gingerly around it as he descended to embrace his grandfather and proclaim him Savior of the City Sansa covered her mouth to hide a nervous smile

Joff made a show of asking his grandfather to assume governance of the realm and Lord Tywin solemnly accepted the responsibility until Your Grace does come of age Then squires removed his armor and Joff fastened the Hand’s chain of office around his neck Lord Tywin took a seat at the council table beside the queen After the destrier was led off and his homage removed Cersei nodded for the ceremonies to continue

A fanfare of brazen trumpets greeted each of the heroes as he stepped between the great oaken doors Heralds cried his name and deeds for all to hear and the noble knights and highborn ladies cheered as lustily as cutthroats at a cockfight Pride of place was given to Mace Tyrell the Lord of Highgarden a once-powerful man gone to fat yet still handsome His sons followed him in Ser Loras and his older brother Ser Garlan the Gallant The three dressed alike in green velvet trimmed with sable

The king descended the throne once more to greet them a great honor He fastened about the throat of each a chain of roses wrought in soft yellow gold from which hung a golden disc with the lion of Lannister picked out in rubies The roses support the lion as the might of Highgarden supports the realm proclaimed Joffrey If there is any boon you would ask of me ask and it shall be yours

And now it comes thought Sansa

Your Grace said Ser Loras I beg the honor of serving in your Kingsguard to defend you against your enemies

Joffrey drew the Knight of Flowers to his feet and kissed him on his cheek Done brother

Lord Tyrell bowed his head There is no greater pleasure than to serve the King’s Grace If I was deemed worthy to join your royal council you would find none more loyal or true

Joff put a hand on Lord Tyrell’s shoulder and kissed him when he stood Your wish is granted

Ser Garlan Tyrell five years senior to Ser Loras was a taller bearded version of his more famous younger brother He was thicker about the chest and broader at the shoulders and though his face was comely enough he lacked Ser Loras’s startling beauty Your Grace Garlan said when the king approached him I have a maiden sister Margaery the delight of our House She was wed to Renly Baratheon as you know but Lord Renly went to war before the marriage could be consummated so she remains innocent Margaery has heard tales of your wisdom courage and chivalry and has come to love you from afar I beseech you to send for her to take her hand in marriage and to wed your House to mine for all time

King Joffrey made a show of looking surprised Ser Garlan your sister’s beauty is famed throughout the Seven Kingdoms but I am promised to another A king must keep his word

Queen Cersei got to her feet in a rustle of skirts Your Grace in the judgment of your small council it would be neither proper nor wise for you to wed the daughter of a man beheaded for treason a girl whose brother is in open rebellion against the throne even now Sire your councillors beg you for the good of your realm set Sansa Stark aside The Lady Margaery will make you a far more suitable queen

Like a pack of trained dogs the lords and ladies in the hall began to shout their pleasure Margaery they called Give us Margaery and No traitor queens Tyrell Tyrell

Joffrey raised a hand I would like to heed the wishes of my people Mother but I took a holy vow

The High Septon stepped forward Your Grace the gods hold bethrothal solemn but your father King Robert of blessed memory made this pact before the Starks of Winterfell had revealed their falseness Their crimes against the realm have freed you from any promise you might have made So far as the Faith is concerned there is no valid marriage contract ’twixt you and Sansa Stark

A tumult of cheering filled the throne room and cries of Margaery Margaery erupted all around her Sansa leaned forward her hands tight around the gallery’s wooden rail She knew what came next but she was still frightened of what Joffrey might say afraid that he would refuse to release her even now when his whole kingdom depended upon it She felt as if she were back again on the marble steps outside the Great Sept of Baelor waiting for her prince to grant her father mercy and instead hearing him command Ilyn Payne to strike off his head Please she prayed fervently make him say it make him say it

Lord Tywin was looking at his grandson Joff gave him a sullen glance shifted his feet and helped Ser Garlan Tyrell to rise The gods are good I am free to heed my heart I will wed your sweet sister and gladly ser He kissed Ser Garlan on a bearded cheek as the cheers rose all around them

Sansa felt curiously light-headed I am free She could feel eyes upon her I must not smile she reminded herself The queen had warned her no matter what she felt inside the face she showed the world must look distraught I will not have my son humiliated Cersei said Do you hear me

Yes But if I’m not to be queen what will become of me

That will need to be determined For the moment you shall remain here at court as our ward

I want to go home

The queen was irritated by that You should have learned by now none of us get the things we want

I have though Sansa thought I am free of Joffrey I will not have to kiss him nor give him my maidenhood nor bear him children Let Margaery Tyrell have all that poor girl

By the time the outburst died down the Lord of Highgarden had been seated at the council table and his sons had joined the other knights and lordlings beneath the windows Sansa tried to look forlorn and abandoned as other heroes of the Battle of the Blackwater were summoned forth to receive their rewards

Paxter Redwyne Lord of the Arbor marched down the length of the hall flanked by his twin sons Horror and Slobber the former limping from a wound taken in the battle After them followed Lord Mathis Rowan in a snowy doublet with a great tree worked upon the breast in gold thread Lord Randyll Tarly lean and balding a greatsword across his back in a jeweled scabbard Ser Kevan Lannister a thickset balding man with a close-trimmed beard Ser Addam Marbrand coppery hair streaming to his shoulders the great western lords Lydden Crakehall and Brax
