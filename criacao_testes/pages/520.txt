Ser Stafford Lannister was slain at Oxcross I am told

Jaime was unmoved Uncle Dolt my sister called him it’s Cersei and Tyrion who concern me As well as my lord father

They live all three But not long if the gods are good

Jaime drank some more wine Ask your next

Catelyn wondered if he would dare answer her next question with anything but a lie How did my son Bran come to fall

I flung him from a window

The easy way he said it took her voice away for an instant If I had a knife I would kill him now she thought until she remembered the girls Her throat constricted as she said You were a knight sworn to defend the weak and innocent

He was weak enough but perhaps not so innocent He was spying on us

Bran would not spy

Then blame those precious gods of yours who brought the boy to our window and gave him a glimpse of something he was never meant to see

Blame the gods she said incredulous Yours was the hand that threw him You meant for him to die

His chains chinked softly I seldom fling children from towers to improve their health Yes I meant for him to die

And when he did not you knew your danger was worse than ever so you gave your catspaw a bag of silver to make certain Bran would never wake

Did I now Jaime lifted his cup and took a long swallow I won’t deny we talked of it but you were with the boy day and night your maester and Lord Eddard attended him frequently and there were guards even those damned direwolves… it would have required cutting my way through half of Winterfell And why bother when the boy seemed like to die of his own accord

If you lie to me this session is at an end Catelyn held out her hands to show him her fingers and palms The man who came to slit Bran’s throat gave me these scars You swear you had no part in sending him

On my honor as a Lannister

Your honor as a Lannister is worth less than this She kicked over the waste pail Foul-smelling brown ooze crept across the floor of the cell soaking into the straw

Jaime Lannister backed away from the spill as far as his chains would allow I may indeed have shit for honor I won’t deny it but I have never yet hired anyone to do my killing Believe what you will Lady Stark but if I had wanted your Bran dead I would have slain him myself

Gods be merciful he’s telling the truth If you did not send the killer your sister did

If so I’d know Cersei keeps no secrets from me

Then it was the Imp

Tyrion is as innocent as your Bran He wasn’t climbing around outside of anyone’s window spying

Then why did the assassin have his dagger

What dagger was this

It was so long she said holding her hands apart plain but finely made with a blade of Valyrian steel and a dragonbone hilt Your brother won it from Lord Baelish at the tourney on Prince Joffrey’s name day

Lannister poured drank poured and stared into his wine cup This wine seems to be improving as I drink it Imagine that I seem to remember that dagger now that you describe it Won it you say How

Wagering on you when you tilted against the Knight of Flowers Yet when she heard her own words Catelyn knew she had gotten it wrong No… was it the other way
