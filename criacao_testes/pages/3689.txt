Clegane’s breath came ragged Bugger that And you

A sellsword stepped up beside him We been out Three times Half our men are killed or hurt Wildfire bursting all around us horses screaming like men and men like horses—

Did you think we hired you to fight in a tourney Shall I bring you a nice iced milk and a bowl of raspberries No Then get on your fucking horse You too dog

The blood on Clegane’s face glistened red but his eyes showed white He drew his longsword

He is afraid Tyrion realized shocked The Hound is frightened He tried to explain their need They’ve taken a ram to the gate you can hear them we need to disperse them—

Open the gates When they rush inside surround them and kill them The Hound thrust the point of his longsword into the ground and leaned upon the pommel swaying I’ve lost half my men Horse as well I’m not taking more into that fire

Ser Mandon Moore moved to Tyrion’s side immaculate in his enameled white plate The King’s Hand commands you

Bugger the King’s Hand Where the Hound’s face was not sticky with blood it was pale as milk Someone bring me a drink A gold cloak officer handed him a cup Clegane took a swallow spit it out flung the cup away Water Fuck your water Bring me wine

He is dead on his feet Tyrion could see it now The wound the fire… he’s done I need to find someone else but who Ser Mandon He looked at the men and knew it would not do Clegane’s fear had shaken them Without a leader they would refuse as well and Ser Mandon… a dangerous man Jaime said yes but not a man other men would follow

In the distance Tyrion heard another great crash Above the walls the darkening sky was awash with sheets of green and orange light How long could the gate hold

This is madness he thought but sooner madness than defeat Defeat is death and shame Very well I’ll lead the sortie

If he thought that would shame the Hound back to valor he was wrong Clegane only laughed You

Tyrion could see the disbelief on their faces Me Ser Mandon you’ll bear the king’s banner Pod my helm The boy ran to obey The Hound leaned on that notched and blood-streaked sword and looked at him with those wide white eyes Ser Mandon helped Tyrion mount up again Form up he shouted

His big red stallion wore crinet and chamfron Crimson silk draped his hindquarters over a coat of mail The high saddle was gilded Podrik Payne handed up helm and shield heavy oak emblazoned with a golden hand on red surrounded by small golden lions He walked his horse in a circle looking at the little force of men Only a handful had responded to his command no more than twenty They sat their horses with eyes as white as the Hound’s He looked contemptuously at the others the knights and sellswords who had ridden with Clegane They say I’m half a man he said What does that make the lot of you

That shamed them well enough A knight mounted helmetless and rode to join the others A pair of sellswords followed Then more The King’s Gate shuddered again In a few moments the size of Tyrion’s command had doubled He had them trapped If I fight they must do the same or they are less than dwarfs

You won’t hear me shout out Joffrey’s name he told them You won’t hear me yell for Casterly Rock either This is your city Stannis means to sack and that’s your gate he’s bringing down So come with me and kill the son of a bitch Tyrion unsheathed his axe wheeled the stallion around and trotted toward the sally port He thought they were following but never dared to look





SANSA

The torches shimmered brightly against the hammered metal of the wall sconces filling the Queen’s Ballroom with silvery light Yet there was still darkness in that hall Sansa could see it in the pale eyes of Ser Ilyn Payne who stood by the back door still as stone taking neither food nor wine She could hear it in Lord Gyles’s racking cough and the whispered voice of Osney Kettleblack when he slipped in to bring Cersei the tidings

Sansa was finishing her broth when he came the first time entering through the back She glimpsed him talking to his brother Osfryd Then he climbed the dais and knelt beside the high seat smelling of horse four long thin scratches on his cheek crusted with scabs his hair falling down past his collar and into his eyes For all his whispering Sansa could not help but hear The fleets are locked in battle Some archers got ashore but the Hound’s cut them to pieces Y’Grace Your brother’s raising his chain I heard the signal Some drunkards down to Flea Bottom are smashing doors and climbing through windows Lord Bywater’s sent the gold cloaks to deal with them Baelor’s Sept is jammed full everyone praying

And my son

The king went to Baelor’s to get the High Septon’s blessing Now he’s walking the walls with the Hand telling the men to be brave lifting their spirits as it were

Cersei beckoned to her page for another cup of wine a golden vintage from the Arbor fruity and rich The queen was drinking heavily but the wine only seemed to make her more beautiful her cheeks were flushed and her eyes had a bright feverish heat to them as she looked down over the hall Eyes of wildfire Sansa thought

Musicians played Jugglers juggled Moon Boy lurched about the hall on stilts making mock of everyone while Ser Dontos chased serving girls on his broomstick horse The guests laughed but it was a joyless laughter the sort of laughter that can turn into sobbing in half a heartbeat Their bodies are here but their thoughts are on the city walls and their hearts as well

After the broth came a salad of apples nuts and raisins At any other time it might have made a tasty dish but tonight all the food was flavored with fear Sansa was not the only one in the hall without an appetite Lord Gyles was coughing more than he was eating Lollys Stokeworth sat hunched and shivering and the young bride of one of Ser Lancel’s knights began to weep uncontrollably The queen commanded Maester Frenken to put her to bed with a cup of dreamwine Tears she said scornfully to Sansa as the woman was led from the hall The woman’s weapon my lady mother used to call them The man’s weapon is a sword And that tells us all you need to know doesn’t it

Men must be very brave though said Sansa To ride out and face swords and axes everyone trying to kill you…

Jaime told me once that he only feels truly alive in battle and in bed She lifted her cup and took a long swallow Her salad was untouched I would sooner face any number of swords than sit helpless like this pretending to enjoy the company of this flock of frightened hens

You asked them here Your Grace

Certain things are expected of a queen They will be expected of you should you ever wed Joffrey Best learn The queen studied the wives daughters and mothers who filled the benches Of themselves the hens are nothing but their cocks are important for one reason or another and some may survive this battle So it behooves me to give their women my protection If my wretched dwarf of a brother should somehow manage to prevail they will return to their husbands and fathers full of tales about how brave I was how my courage inspired them and lifted their spirits how I never doubted our victory even for a moment

And if the castle should fall

You’d like that wouldn’t you Cersei did not wait for a denial If I’m not betrayed by my own guards I may be able to hold here for a time Then I can go to the walls and offer to yield to Lord Stannis in person That will spare us the worst But if Maegor’s Holdfast should fall before Stannis can come up why then most of my guests are in for a bit of rape I’d say And you should never rule out mutilation torture and murder at times like these

Sansa was horrified These are women unarmed and gently born

Their birth protects them Cersei admitted though not as much as you’d think Each one’s worth a good ransom but after the madness of battle soldiers often seem to want flesh more than coin Even so a golden shield is better than none Out in the streets the women won’t be treated near as tenderly Nor will our servants Pretty things like that serving wench of Lady Tanda’s could be in for a lively night but don’t imagine the old and the infirm and the ugly will be spared Enough drink will make blind washerwomen and reeking pig girls seem as comely as you sweetling

Me

Try not to sound so like a mouse Sansa You’re a woman now remember And betrothed to my firstborn The queen sipped at her wine Were it anyone else outside the gates I might hope to beguile him But this is Stannis Baratheon I’d have a better chance of seducing his horse She noticed the look on Sansa’s face and laughed Have I shocked you my lady She leaned close You little fool Tears are not a woman’s only weapon You’ve got another one between your legs and you’d best learn to use it You’ll find men use their swords freely enough Both kinds of swords

Sansa was spared the need to reply when two Kettleblacks reentered the hall Ser Osmund and his brothers had become great favorites about the castle they were always ready with a smile and a jest and got on with grooms and huntsmen as well as they did with knights and squires With the serving wenches they got on best of all it was gossiped Of late Ser Osmund had taken Sandor Clegane’s place by Joffrey’s side and Sansa had heard the women at the washing well saying he was as strong as the Hound only younger and faster If that was so she wondered why she had never once heard of these Kettleblacks before Ser Osmund was named to the Kingsguard

Osney was all smiles as he knelt beside the queen The hulks have gone up Y’Grace The whole Blackwater’s awash with wildfire A hundred ships burning maybe more

And my son

He’s at the Mud Gate with the Hand and the Kingsguard Y’Grace He spoke to the archers on the hoardings before and gave them a few tips on handling a crossbow he did All agree he’s a right brave boy

He’d best remain a right live boy Cersei turned to his brother Osfryd who was taller sterner and wore a drooping black mustache Yes

Osfryd had donned a steel halfhelm over his long black hair and the look on his face was grim Y’Grace he said quietly the boys caught a groom and two maidservants trying to sneak out a postern with three of the king’s horses

The night’s first traitors the queen said but not the last I fear Have Ser Ilyn see to them and put their heads on pikes outside the stables as a warning As they left she turned to Sansa Another lesson you should learn if you hope to sit beside my son Be gentle on a night like this and you’ll have treasons popping up all about you like mushrooms after a hard rain The only way to keep your people loyal is to make certain they fear you more than they do the enemy

I will remember Your Grace said Sansa though she had always heard that love was a surer route to the people’s loyalty than fear If I am ever a queen I’ll make them love me

Crabclaw pies followed the salad Then came mutton roasted with leeks and carrots served in trenchers of hollowed bread Lollys ate too fast got sick and retched all over herself and her sister Lord Gyles coughed drank coughed drank and passed out The queen gazed down in disgust to where he sprawled with his face in his trencher and his hand in a puddle of wine The gods must have been mad to waste manhood on the likes of him and I must have been mad to demand his release

Osfryd Kettleblack returned crimson cloak swirling There’s folks gathering in the square Y’Grace asking to take refuge in the castle Not a mob rich merchants and the like

Command them to return to their homes the queen said If they won’t go have our crossbowmen kill a few No sorties I won’t have the gates opened for any reason

As you command He bowed and moved off

The queen’s face was hard and angry Would that I could take a sword to their necks myself Her voice was starting to slur When we were little Jaime and I were so much alike that even our lord father could not tell us apart Sometimes as a lark we would dress in each other’s clothes and spend a whole day each as the other Yet even so when Jaime was given his first sword there was none for me ‘What do I get’ I remember asking We were so much alike I could never understand why they treated us so differently Jaime learned to fight with sword and lance and mace while I was taught to smile and sing and please He was heir to Casterly Rock while I was to be sold to some stranger like a horse to be ridden whenever my new owner liked beaten whenever he liked and cast aside in time for a younger filly Jaime’s lot was to be glory and power while mine was birth and moonblood

But you were queen of all the Seven Kingdoms Sansa said
