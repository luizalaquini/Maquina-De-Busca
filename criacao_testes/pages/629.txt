I have so looked forward to our supper

As has Margaery and my lady grandmother as well He took her arm and led her toward the steps

Your grandmother Sansa was finding it hard to walk and talk and think all at the same time with Ser Loras touching her arm She could feel the warmth of his hand through the silk

Lady Olenna She is to sup with you as well

Oh said Sansa I am talking to him and he’s touching me he’s holding my arm and touching me The Queen of Thorns she’s called Isn’t that right

It is Ser Loras laughed He has the warmest laugh she thought as he went on You’d best not use that name in her presence though or you’re like to get pricked

Sansa reddened Any fool would have realized that no woman would be happy about being called the Queen of Thorns Maybe I truly am as stupid as Cersei Lannister says Desperately she tried to think of something clever and charming to say to him but her wits had deserted her She almost told him how beautiful he was until she remembered that she’d already done that

He was beautiful though He seemed taller than he’d been when she’d first met him but still so lithe and graceful and Sansa had never seen another boy with such wonderful eyes He’s no boy though he’s a man grown a knight of the Kingsguard She thought he looked even finer in white than in the greens and golds of House Tyrell The only spot of color on him now was the brooch that clasped his cloak the rose of Highgarden wrought in soft yellow gold nestled in a bed of delicate green jade leaves

Ser Balon Swann held the door of Maegor’s for them to pass He was all in white as well though he did not wear it half so well as Ser Loras Beyond the spiked moat two dozen men were taking their practice with sword and shield With the castle so crowded the outer ward had been given over to guests to raise their tents and pavilions leaving only the smaller inner yards for training One of the Redwyne twins was being driven backward by Ser Tallad with the eyes on his shield Chunky Ser Kennos of Kayce who chuffed and puffed every time he raised his longsword seemed to be holding his own against Osney Kettleblack but Osney’s brother Ser Osfryd was savagely punishing the frog-faced squire Morros Slynt Blunted swords or no Slynt would have a rich crop of bruises by the morrow It made Sansa wince just to watch They have scarcely finished burying the dead from the last battle and already they are practicing for the next one

On the edge of the yard a lone knight with a pair of golden roses on his shield was holding off three foes Even as they watched he caught one of them alongside the head knocking him senseless Is that your brother Sansa asked

It is my lady said Ser Loras Garlan often trains against three men or even four In battle it is seldom one against one he says so he likes to be prepared

He must be very brave

He is a great knight Ser Loras replied A better sword than me in truth though I’m the better lance

I remember said Sansa You ride wonderfully ser

My lady is gracious to say so When has she seen me ride

At the Hand’s tourney don’t you remember You rode a white courser and your armor was a hundred different kinds of flowers You gave me a rose A red rose You threw white roses to the other girls that day It made her flush to speak of it You said no victory was half as beautiful as me

Ser Loras gave her a modest smile I spoke only a simple truth that any man with eyes could see

He doesn’t remember Sansa realized startled He is only being kind to me he doesn’t remember me or the rose or any of it She had been so certain that it meant something that it meant everything A red rose not a white It was after you unhorsed Ser Robar Royce she said desperately

He took his hand from her arm I slew Robar at Storm’s End my lady It was not a boast he sounded sad

Him and another of King Renly’s Rainbow Guard as well yes Sansa had heard the women talking of it round the well but for a moment she’d forgotten That was when Lord Renly was killed wasn’t it How terrible for your poor sister

For Margaery His voice was tight To be sure She was at Bitterbridge though She did not see

Even so when she heard…

Ser Loras brushed the hilt of his sword lightly with his hand Its grip was white leather its pommel a rose in alabaster Renly is dead Robar as well What use to speak of them

The sharpness in his tone took her aback I… my lord I… I did not mean to give offense ser

Nor could you Lady Sansa Ser Loras replied but all the warmth had gone from his voice Nor did he take her arm again

They ascended the serpentine steps in a deepening silence

Oh why did I have to mention Ser Robar Sansa thought I’ve ruined everything He is angry with me now She tried to think of something she might say to make amends but all the words that came to her were lame and weak Be quiet or you will only make it worse she told herself
