brethren  66 But brother goeth to law with brother and that before
the unbelievers

67 Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you because ye go to
law one with another Why do ye not rather take wrong why do ye not
rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded  68 Nay ye do wrong and
defraud and that your brethren

69 Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of
God  Be not deceived neither fornicators nor idolaters nor
adulterers nor effeminate nor abusers of themselves with mankind
610 Nor thieves nor covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor
extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of God

611 And such were some of you but ye are washed but ye are
sanctified but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by
the Spirit of our God

612 All things are lawful unto me but all things are not expedient
all things are lawful for me but I will not be brought under the
power of any

613 Meats for the belly and the belly for meats but God shall
destroy both it and them Now the body is not for fornication but for
the Lord and the Lord for the body

614 And God hath both raised up the Lord and will also raise up us
by his own power

615 Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ shall I
then take the members of Christ and make them the members of an
harlot God forbid

616 What know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one
body  for two saith he shall be one flesh

617 But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit

618 Flee fornication Every sin that a man doeth is without the body
but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body

619 What know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost
which is in you which ye have of God and ye are not your own  620
For ye are bought with a price therefore glorify God in your body
and in your spirit which are Gods

71 Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me It is good for
a man not to touch a woman

72 Nevertheless to avoid fornication let every man have his own
wife and let every woman have her own husband

73 Let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence and likewise
also the wife unto the husband

74 The wife hath not power of her own body but the husband and
likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body but the
wife

75 Defraud ye not one the other except it be with consent for a
time that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer and come
together again that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency

76 But I speak this by permission and not of commandment

77 For I would that all men were even as I myself But every man hath
his proper gift of God one after this manner and another after that

78 I say therefore to the unmarried and widows It is good for them
if they abide even as I

79 But if they cannot contain let them marry for it is better to
marry than to burn

710 And unto the married I command yet not I but the Lord Let not
the wife depart from her husband 711 But and if she depart let her
remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband and let not the
husband put away his wife

712 But to the rest speak I not the Lord If any brother hath a wife
that believeth not and she be pleased to dwell with him let him not
put her away

713 And the woman which hath an husband that believeth not and if he
be pleased to dwell with her let her not leave him

714 For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife and the
unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband else were your children
unclean but now are they holy

715 But if the unbelieving depart let him depart A brother or a
sister is not under bondage in such cases but God hath called us to
peace

716 For what knowest thou O wife whether thou shalt save thy
husband  or how knowest thou O man whether thou shalt save thy
wife  717 But as God hath distributed to every man as the Lord hath
called every one so let him walk And so ordain I in all churches

718 Is any man called being circumcised let him not become
