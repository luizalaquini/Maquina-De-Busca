4914 I have heard a rumour from the LORD and an ambassador is sent
unto the heathen saying Gather ye together and come against her
and rise up to the battle

4915 For lo I will make thee small among the heathen and despised
among men

4916 Thy terribleness hath deceived thee and the pride of thine
heart O thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock that holdest
the height of the hill though thou shouldest make thy nest as high as
the eagle I will bring thee down from thence saith the LORD

4917 Also Edom shall be a desolation every one that goeth by it
shall be astonished and shall hiss at all the plagues thereof

4918 As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour
cities thereof saith the LORD no man shall abide there neither
shall a son of man dwell in it

4919 Behold he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan
against the habitation of the strong but I will suddenly make him run
away from her and who is a chosen man that I may appoint over her
for who is like me and who will appoint me the time and who is that
shepherd that will stand before me  4920 Therefore hear the counsel
of the LORD that he hath taken against Edom and his purposes that
he hath purposed against the inhabitants of Teman Surely the least of
the flock shall draw them out surely he shall make their habitations
desolate with them

4921 The earth is moved at the noise of their fall at the cry the
noise thereof was heard in the Red sea

4922 Behold he shall come up and fly as the eagle and spread his
wings over Bozrah and at that day shall the heart of the mighty men
of Edom be as the heart of a woman in her pangs

4923 Concerning Damascus Hamath is confounded and Arpad for they
have heard evil tidings they are fainthearted there is sorrow on the
sea it cannot be quiet

4924 Damascus is waxed feeble and turneth herself to flee and fear
hath seized on her anguish and sorrows have taken her as a woman in
travail

4925 How is the city of praise not left the city of my joy  4926
Therefore her young men shall fall in her streets and all the men of
war shall be cut off in that day saith the LORD of hosts

4927 And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus and it shall
consume the palaces of Benhadad

4928 Concerning Kedar and concerning the kingdoms of Hazor which
Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon shall smite thus saith the LORD Arise
ye go up to Kedar and spoil the men of the east

4929 Their tents and their flocks shall they take away they shall
take to themselves their curtains and all their vessels and their
camels and they shall cry unto them Fear is on every side

4930 Flee get you far off dwell deep O ye inhabitants of Hazor
saith the LORD for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath taken counsel
against you and hath conceived a purpose against you

4931 Arise get you up unto the wealthy nation that dwelleth without
care saith the LORD which have neither gates nor bars which dwell
alone

4932 And their camels shall be a booty and the multitude of their
cattle a spoil and I will scatter into all winds them that are in the
utmost corners and I will bring their calamity from all sides
thereof saith the LORD

4933 And Hazor shall be a dwelling for dragons and a desolation for
ever there shall no man abide there nor any son of man dwell in it

4934 The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet against
Elam in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah saying
4935 Thus saith the LORD of hosts Behold I will break the bow of
Elam the chief of their might

4936 And upon Elam will I bring the four winds from the four quarters
of heaven and will scatter them toward all those winds and there
shall be no nation whither the outcasts of Elam shall not come

4937 For I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies and
before them that seek their life and I will bring evil upon them
even my fierce anger saith the LORD and I will send the sword after
them till I have consumed them 4938 And I will set my throne in
Elam and will destroy from thence the king and the princes saith the
LORD

4939 But it shall come to pass in the latter days that I will bring
again the captivity of Elam saith the LORD

501 The word that the LORD spake against Babylon and against the land
of the Chaldeans by Jeremiah the prophet

502 Declare ye among the nations and publish and set up a standard
publish and conceal not say Babylon is taken Bel is confounded
Merodach is broken in pieces her idols are confounded her images are
