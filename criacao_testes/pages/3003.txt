thy merchants from thy youth they shall wander every one to his
quarter none shall save thee

481 Hear ye this O house of Jacob which are called by the name of
Israel and are come forth out of the waters of Judah which swear by
the name of the LORD and make mention of the God of Israel but not
in truth nor in righteousness

482 For they call themselves of the holy city and stay themselves
upon the God of Israel The LORD of hosts is his name

483 I have declared the former things from the beginning and they
went forth out of my mouth and I shewed them I did them suddenly
and they came to pass

484 Because I knew that thou art obstinate and thy neck is an iron
sinew and thy brow brass 485 I have even from the beginning
declared it to thee before it came to pass I shewed it thee lest
thou shouldest say Mine idol hath done them and my graven image and
my molten image hath commanded them

486 Thou hast heard see all this and will not ye declare it I have
shewed thee new things from this time even hidden things and thou
didst not know them

487 They are created now and not from the beginning even before the
day when thou heardest them not lest thou shouldest say Behold I
knew them

488 Yea thou heardest not yea thou knewest not yea from that
time that thine ear was not opened for I knew that thou wouldest deal
very treacherously and wast called a transgressor from the womb

489 For my names sake will I defer mine anger and for my praise
will I refrain for thee that I cut thee not off

4810 Behold I have refined thee but not with silver I have chosen
thee in the furnace of affliction

4811 For mine own sake even for mine own sake will I do it for how
should my name be polluted and I will not give my glory unto another

4812 Hearken unto me O Jacob and Israel my called I am he I am
the first I also am the last

4813 Mine hand also hath laid the foundation of the earth and my
right hand hath spanned the heavens when I call unto them they stand
up together

4814 All ye assemble yourselves and hear which among them hath
declared these things The LORD hath loved him he will do his
pleasure on Babylon and his arm shall be on the Chaldeans

4815 I even I have spoken yea I have called him I have brought
him and he shall make his way prosperous

4816 Come ye near unto me hear ye this I have not spoken in secret
from the beginning from the time that it was there am I and now the
Lord GOD and his Spirit hath sent me

4817 Thus saith the LORD thy Redeemer the Holy One of Israel I am
the LORD thy God which teacheth thee to profit which leadeth thee by
the way that thou shouldest go

4818 O that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments then had thy
peace been as a river and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea
4819 Thy seed also had been as the sand and the offspring of thy
bowels like the gravel thereof his name should not have been cut off
nor destroyed from before me

4820 Go ye forth of Babylon flee ye from the Chaldeans with a voice
of singing declare ye tell this utter it even to the end of the
earth say ye The LORD hath redeemed his servant Jacob

4821 And they thirsted not when he led them through the deserts he
caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them he clave the rock
also and the waters gushed out

4822 There is no peace saith the LORD unto the wicked

491 Listen O isles unto me and hearken ye people from far The
LORD hath called me from the womb from the bowels of my mother hath
he made mention of my name

492 And he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword in the shadow of
his hand hath he hid me and made me a polished shaft in his quiver
hath he hid me 493 And said unto me Thou art my servant O Israel
in whom I will be glorified

494 Then I said I have laboured in vain I have spent my strength
for nought and in vain yet surely my judgment is with the LORD and
my work with my God

495 And now saith the LORD that formed me from the womb to be his
servant to bring Jacob again to him Though Israel be not gathered
yet shall I be glorious in the eyes of the LORD and my God shall be
my strength

496 And he said It is a light thing that thou shouldest be my
servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob and to restore the preserved
