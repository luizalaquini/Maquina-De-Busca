only

812 And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh and Moses cried unto
the LORD because of the frogs which he had brought against Pharaoh

813 And the LORD did according to the word of Moses and the frogs
died out of the houses out of the villages and out of the fields

814 And they gathered them together upon heaps and the land stank

815 But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite he hardened his
heart and hearkened not unto them as the LORD had said

816 And the LORD said unto Moses Say unto Aaron Stretch out thy
rod and smite the dust of the land that it may become lice
throughout all the land of Egypt

817 And they did so for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod
and smote the dust of the earth and it became lice in man and in
beast all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of
Egypt

818 And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth
lice but they could not so there were lice upon man and upon beast

819 Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh This is the finger of God
and Pharaohs heart was hardened and he hearkened not unto them as
the LORD had said

820 And the LORD said unto Moses Rise up early in the morning and
stand before Pharaoh lo he cometh forth to the water and say unto
him Thus saith the LORD Let my people go that they may serve me

821 Else if thou wilt not let my people go behold I will send
swarms of flies upon thee and upon thy servants and upon thy people
and into thy houses and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of
swarms of flies and also the ground whereon they are

822 And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen in which my
people dwell that no swarms of flies shall be there to the end thou
mayest know that I am the LORD in the midst of the earth

823 And I will put a division between my people and thy people to
morrow shall this sign be

824 And the LORD did so and there came a grievous swarm of flies
into the house of Pharaoh and into his servants houses and into all
the land of Egypt the land was corrupted by reason of the swarm of
flies

825 And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron and said Go ye
sacrifice to your God in the land

826 And Moses said It is not meet so to do for we shall sacrifice
the abomination of the Egyptians to the LORD our God lo shall we
sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes and will
they not stone us  827 We will go three days journey into the
wilderness and sacrifice to the LORD our God as he shall command us

828 And Pharaoh said I will let you go that ye may sacrifice to the
LORD your God in the wilderness only ye shall not go very far away
intreat for me

829 And Moses said Behold I go out from thee and I will intreat
the LORD that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh from his
servants and from his people to morrow but let not Pharaoh deal
deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the
LORD

830 And Moses went out from Pharaoh and intreated the LORD

831 And the LORD did according to the word of Moses and he removed
the swarms of flies from Pharaoh from his servants and from his
people there remained not one

832 And Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also neither would
he let the people go

91 Then the LORD said unto Moses Go in unto Pharaoh and tell him
Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews Let my people go that they
may serve me

92 For if thou refuse to let them go and wilt hold them still 93
Behold the hand of the LORD is upon thy cattle which is in the field
upon the horses upon the asses upon the camels upon the oxen and
upon the sheep there shall be a very grievous murrain

94 And the LORD shall sever between the cattle of Israel and the
cattle of Egypt and there shall nothing die of all that is the
childrens of Israel

95 And the LORD appointed a set time saying To morrow the LORD
shall do this thing in the land

96 And the LORD did that thing on the morrow and all the cattle of
Egypt died but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one

97 And Pharaoh sent and behold there was not one of the cattle of
the Israelites dead And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened and he did
not let the people go
