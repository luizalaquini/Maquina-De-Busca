And if you don’t the voice asked

The ground was closer now still far far away a thousand miles away but closer than it had been It was cold here in the darkness There was no sun no stars only the ground below coming up to smash him and the grey mists and the whispering voice He wanted to cry

Not cry Fly

I can’t fly Bran said I can’t I can’t…

How do you know Have you ever tried

The voice was high and thin Bran looked around to see where it was coming from A crow was spiraling down with him just out of reach following him as he fell Help me he said

I’m trying the crow replied Say got any corn

Bran reached into his pocket as the darkness spun dizzily around him When he pulled his hand out golden kernels slid from between his fingers into the air They fell with him

The crow landed on his hand and began to eat

Are you really a crow Bran asked

Are you really falling the crow asked back

It’s just a dream Bran said

Is it asked the crow

I’ll wake up when I hit the ground Bran told the bird

You’ll die when you hit the ground the crow said It went back to eating corn

Bran looked down He could see mountains now their peaks white with snow and the silver thread of rivers in dark woods He closed his eyes and began to cry

That won’t do any good the crow said I told you the answer is flying not crying How hard can it be I’m doing it The crow took to the air and flapped around Bran’s hand

You have wings Bran pointed out

Maybe you do too

Bran felt along his shoulders groping for feathers

There are different kinds of wings the crow said

Bran was staring at his arms his legs He was so skinny just skin stretched taut over bones Had he always been so thin He tried to remember A face swam up at him out of the grey mist shining with light golden The things I do for love it said

Bran screamed

The crow took to the air cawing Not that it shrieked at him Forget that you do not need it now put it aside put it away It landed on Bran’s shoulder and pecked at him and the shining golden face was gone

Bran was falling faster than ever The grey mists howled around him as he plunged toward the earth below What are you doing to me he asked the crow tearful

Teaching you how to fly

I can’t fly
