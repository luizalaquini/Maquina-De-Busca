And when the wedding was over wed have it put
in the newspaper list of marriages
 Dearly I should like that  
And the babies in the births -- every man jack of
em And at home by the fire whenever you look up
there I shall be -- and whenever I look up there will
be you
Wait wait and dont be improper 
Her countenance fell and she was silent awhile
He regarded the red berries between them over and
over again to such an extent that holly seemed in
his after life to be a cypher signifying a proposal of
marriage Bathsheba decisively turned to him
No tis no use she said I dont want to marry
you 
 Try
I have tried hard all the time Ive been thinking
for a marriage would be very nice in one sense
People would talk about me and think I had won my
battle and I should feel triumphant and all that
But a husband --  --  - +
 Well  
 Why hed always be there as you say whenever
I looked up there hed be
 Of course he would -- I that is
P 80
 Well what I mean is that I shouldnt mind being
a bride at a wedding if I could be one without having
a husband But since a woman cant show off in that
way by herself I shant marry -- at least yet
 Thats a terrible wooden story
At this criticism of her statement Bathsheba made
an addition to her dignity by a slight sweep away
from him
Upon my heart and soul I dont know what a
maid can say stupider than that said Oak But
dearest he continued in a palliative voice dont be
like it  Oak sighed a deep honest sigh -- none the
less so in that being like the sigh of a pine plantation
it was rather noticeable as a disturbance of the atmo+
sphere  Why wont you have me   he appealed
creeping round the holly to reach her side
 I cannot she said retreating
But why  he persisted standing still at last in
despair of ever reaching her and facing over the
bush
 Because I dont love you
 Yes but --  -- 
She contracted a yawn to an inoffensive smallness
so that it was hardly ill-mannered at all I dont love
you she said
But I love you -- and as for myself I am content
to be liked
 O Mr Oak -- thats very fine  Youd get to
despise me
Never said Mr Oak so earnestly that he seemed
to be coming by the forceof his words straight
through the bush and into her arms I shall do one
thing in this life -- one thing certain -- that is love you
and long for you and keep wanting you till I die His
voice had a genuine pathos now and his large brown
hands perceptibly trembled
It seems dreadfully wrong not to have you when
you feel so much she said with a little distress and
looking hopeleely around for some means of escape
from her moral dilemma  How I wish I hadnt run
after you However she seemed to have a short cut
for getting back to cheerfulness and set her face to
signify archness It wouldnt do Mr Oak I want
somebody to tame me I am too independent  and
you would never be able to I know
P 81
Oak cast his eyes down the field in a way implying
that it was useless to attempt argument
 Mr Oak she said with luminous distinctness and
common sense  you are better off than I I have
hardly a penny in the world -- I am staying with my
aunt for my bare sustenance I am better educated
than you -- and I dont love you a bit thats my side
of the case Now yours you are a farmer just begin+
ing and you ought in common prudence if you marry
at all which you should certainly not think of doing
at present to marry a woman with money who would
admiration
Thats the very thing I had been thinking myself 
he naively said
Farmer Oak had one-and-a-half Christian character
istics too many to succeed with Bathsheba  his humility
and a superfluous moiety of honesty Bathsheba was
decidedly disconcerted
Well then why did you come and disturb me
she said almost angrily if not quite an enlarging red
spot rising in each cheek
 I cant do what I think would be -- would be --  -- 
 Right  
 No  wise
 You have made an admission now Mr Oak she
exclaimed with even more hauteur and rocking her
head disdainfully After that do you think I could
marry you Not if I know it
