Her eyes widened She wouldn’t—

—kill Jaime Why not What would you do if Joffrey and Tommen were murdered

I still hold Sansa the queen declared

We still hold Sansa he corrected her and we had best take good care of her Now where is this supper you’ve promised me sweet sister

Cersei set a tasty table that could not be denied They started with a creamy chestnut soup crusty hot bread and greens dressed with apples and pine nuts Then came lamprey pie honeyed ham buttered carrots white beans and bacon and roast swan stuffed with mushrooms and oysters Tyrion was exceedingly courteous he offered his sister the choice portions of every dish and made certain he ate only what she did Not that he truly thought she’d poison him but it never hurt to be careful

The news about the Starks had soured her he could see We’ve had no word from Bitterbridge she asked anxiously as she speared a bit of apple on the point of her dagger and ate it with small delicate bites

None

I’ve never trusted Littlefinger For enough coin he’d go over to Stannis in a heartbeat

Stannis Baratheon is too bloody righteous to buy men Nor would he make a comfortable lord for the likes of Petyr This war has made for some queer bedfellows I agree but those two No

As he carved some slices off the ham she said We have Lady Tanda to thank for the pig

A token of her love

A bribe She begs leave to return to her castle Your leave as well as mine I suspect she fears you’ll arrest her on the road as you did Lord Gyles

Does she plan to make off with the heir to the throne Tyrion served his sister a cut of ham and took one for himself I’d sooner she remain If she wants to feel safe tell her to bring down her garrison from Stokeworth As many men as she has

If we need men so badly why did you send away your savages A certain testiness crept into Cersei’s voice

It was the best use I could have made of them he told her truthfully They’re fierce warriors but not soldiers In formal battle discipline is more important than courage They’ve already done us more good in the kingswood than they would ever have done us on the city walls

As the swan was being served the queen questioned him about the conspiracy of the Antler Men She seemed more annoyed than afraid Why are we plagued with so many treasons What injury has House Lannister ever done these wretches

None said Tyrion but they think to be on the winning side… which makes them fools as well as traitors

Are you certain you’ve found them all

Varys says so The swan was too rich for his taste

A line appeared on Cersei’s pale white brow between those lovely eyes You put too much trust in that eunuch

He serves me well

Or so he’d have you believe You think you’re the only one he whispers secrets to He gives each of us just enough to convince us that we’d be helpless without him He played the same game with me when I first wed Robert For years I was convinced I had no truer friend at court but now… She studied his face for a moment He says you mean to take the Hound from Joffrey

Damn Varys I need Clegane for more important duties

Nothing is more important than the life of the king

The life of the king is not at risk Joff will have brave Ser Osmund guarding him and Meryn Trant as well They’re good for nothing better I need Balon Swann and the Hound to lead sorties to make certain Stannis gets no toehold on our side of the Blackwater

Jaime would lead the sorties himself

From Riverrun That’s quite a sortie
