The knight scrambled up edging away with such alacrity that some of the watchers laughed aloud Thank you my lord

Your Grace barked Lord Umber the Greatjon ever the loudest of Robb’s northern bannermen… and the truest and fiercest as well or so he insisted He had been the first to proclaim her son King in the North and he would brook no slight to the honor of his new-made sovereign

Your Grace Ser Cleos corrected hastily Pardons

He is not a bold man this one Catelyn thought More of a Frey than a Lannister in truth His cousin the Kingslayer would have been a much different matter They would never have gotten that honorific through Ser Jaime Lannister’s perfect teeth

I brought you from your cell to carry my message to your cousin Cersei Lannister in King’s Landing You’ll travel under a peace banner with thirty of my best men to escort you

Ser Cleos was visibly relieved Then I should be most glad to bring His Grace’s message to the queen

Understand Robb said I am not giving you your freedom Your grandfather Lord Walder pledged me his support and that of House Frey Many of your cousins and uncles rode with us in the Whispering Wood but you chose to fight beneath the lion banner That makes you a Lannister not a Frey I want your pledge on your honor as a knight that after you deliver my message you’ll return with the queen’s reply and resume your captivity

Ser Cleos answered at once I do so vow

Every man in this hall has heard you warned Catelyn’s brother Ser Edmure Tully who spoke for Riverrun and the lords of the Trident in the place of their dying father If you do not return the whole realm will know you forsworn

I will do as I pledged Ser Cleos replied stiffly What is this message 

An offer of peace Robb stood longsword in hand Grey Wind moved to his side The hall grew hushed Tell the Queen Regent that if she meets my terms I will sheath this sword and make an end to the war between us

In the back of the hall Catelyn glimpsed the tall gaunt figure of Lord Rickard Karstark shove through a rank of guards and out the door No one else moved Robb paid the disruption no mind Olyvar the paper he commanded The squire took his longsword and handed up a rolled parchment

Robb unrolled it First the queen must release my sisters and provide them with transport by sea from King’s Landing to White Harbor It is to be understood that Sansa’s betrothal to Joffrey Baratheon is at an end When I receive word from my castellan that my sisters have returned unharmed to Winterfell I will release the queen’s cousins the squire Willem Lannister and your brother Tion Frey and give them safe escort to Casterly Rock or wheresoever she desires them delivered

Catelyn Stark wished she could read the thoughts that hid behind each face each furrowed brow and pair of tightened lips

Secondly my lord father’s bones will be returned to us so he may rest beside his brother and sister in the crypts beneath Winterfell as he would have wished The remains of the men of his household guard who died in his service at King’s Landing must also be returned

Living men had gone south and cold bones would return Ned had the truth of it she thought His place was at Winterfell he said as much but would I hear him No Go I told him you must be Robert’s Hand for the good of our House for the sake of our children… my doing mine no other…

Third my father’s greatsword Ice will be delivered to my hand here at Riverrun

She watched her brother Ser Edmure Tully as he stood with his thumbs hooked over his swordbelt his face as still as stone

Fourth the queen will command her father Lord Tywin to release those knights and lords bannermen of mine that he took captive in the battle on the Green Fork of the Trident Once he does so I shall release my own captives taken in the Whispering Wood and the Battle of the Camps save Jaime Lannister alone who will remain my hostage for his father’s good behavior

She studied Theon Greyjoy’s sly smile wondering what it meant That young man had a way of looking as though he knew some secret jest that only he was privy to Catelyn had never liked it

Lastly King Joffrey and the Queen Regent must renounce all claims to dominion over the north Henceforth we are no part of their realm but a free and independent kingdom as of old Our domain shall include all the Stark lands north of the Neck and in addition the lands watered by the River Trident and its vassal streams bounded by the Golden Tooth to the west and the Mountains of the Moon in the east

THE KING IN THE NORTH boomed Greatjon Umber a ham-sized fist hammering at the air as he shouted Stark Stark The King in the North

Robb rolled up the parchment again Maester Vyman has drawn a map showing the borders we claim You shall have a copy for the queen Lord Tywin must withdraw beyond these borders and cease his raiding burning and pillage The Queen Regent and her son shall make no claims to taxes incomes nor service from my people and shall free my lords and knights from all oaths of fealty vows pledges debts and obligations owed to the Iron Throne and the Houses Baratheon and Lannister Additionally the Lannisters shall deliver ten highborn hostages to be mutually agreed upon as a pledge of peace These I will treat as honored guests according to their station So long as the terms of this pact are abided with faithfully I shall release two hostages every year and return them safely to their families Robb tossed the rolled parchment at the knight’s feet There are the terms If she meets them I’ll give her peace if not—he whistled and Grey Wind moved forward snarling—I’ll give her another Whispering Wood

Stark the Greatjon roared again and now other voices took up the cry Stark Stark King in the North The direwolf threw back his head and howled

Ser Cleos had gone the color of curdled milk The queen shall hear your message my—Your Grace

Good Robb said Ser Robin see that he has a good meal and clean clothing He’s to ride at first light

As you command Your Grace Ser Robin Ryger replied
