It seems it was Your Grace said Brown Ben Plumm

She was pleased Meereen had been sacked savagely as new-fallen cities always were but Dany was determined that should end now that the city was hers She had decreed that murderers were to be hanged that looters were to lose a hand and rapists their manhood Eight killers swung from the walls and the Unsullied had filled a bushel basket with bloody hands and soft red worms but Meereen was calm again But for how long

A fly buzzed her head Dany waved it off irritated but it returned almost at once There are too many flies in this city

Ben Plumm gave a bark of laughter There were flies in my ale this morning I swallowed one of them

Flies are the dead man’s revenge Daario smiled and stroked the center prong of his beard Corpses breed maggots and maggots breed flies

We will rid ourselves of the corpses then Starting with those in the plaza below Grey Worm will you see to it

The queen commands these ones obey

Best bring sacks as well as shovels Worm Brown Ben counseled Well past ripe those ones Falling off those poles in bits and pieces and crawling with   

He knows So do I Dany remembered the horror she had felt when she had seen the Plaza of Punishment in Astapor I made a horror just as great but surely they deserved it Harsh justice is still justice

Your Grace said Missandei Ghiscari inter their honored dead in crypts below their manses If you would boil the bones clean and return them to their kin it would be a kindness

The widows will curse me all the same Let it be done Dany beckoned to Daario How many seek audience this morning

Two have presented themselves to bask in your radiance

Daario had plundered himself a whole new wardrobe in Meereen and to match it he had redyed his trident beard and curly hair a deep rich purple It made his eyes look almost purple too as if he were some lost Valyrian They arrived in the night on the Indigo Star a trading galley out of Qarth

A slaver you mean Dany frowned Who are they

The Star’s master and one who claims to speak for Astapor

I will see the envoy first

He proved to be a pale ferret-faced man with ropes of pearls and spun gold hanging heavy about his neck Your Worship he cried My name is Ghael I bring greetings to the Mother of Dragons from King Cleon of Astapor Cleon the Great

Dany stiffened I left a council to rule Astapor A healer a scholar and a priest

Your Worship those sly rogues betrayed your trust It was revealed that they were scheming to restore the Good Masters to power and the people to chains Great Cleon exposed their plots and hacked their heads off with a cleaver and the grateful folk of Astapor have crowned him for his valor

Noble Ghael said Missandei in the dialect of Astapor is this the same Cleon once owned by Grazdan mo Ullhor

Her voice was guileless yet the question plainly made the envoy anxious The same he admitted A great man

Missandei leaned close to Dany He was a butcher in Grazdan’s kitchen the girl whispered in her ear It was said he could slaughter a pig faster than any man in Astapor

I have given Astapor a butcher king Dany felt ill but she knew she must not let the envoy see it I will pray that King Cleon rules well and wisely What would he have of me

Ghael rubbed his mouth Perhaps we should speak more privily Your Grace

I have no secrets from my captains and commanders

As you wish Great Cleon bids me declare his devotion to the Mother of Dragons Your enemies are his enemies he says and chief among them are the Wise Masters of Yunkai He proposes a pact between Astapor and Meereen against the Yunkai’i

I swore no harm would come to Yunkai if they released their slaves said Dany

These Yunkish dogs cannot be trusted Your Worship Even now they plot against you New levies have been raised and can be seen drilling outside the city walls warships are being built envoys have been sent to New Ghis and Volantis in the west to make alliances and hire sellswords They have even dispatched riders to Vaes Dothrak to bring a khalasar down upon you Great Cleon bid me tell you not to be afraid Astapor remembers Astapor will not forsake you To prove his faith Great Cleon offers to seal your alliance with a marriage

A marriage To me

Ghael smiled His teeth were brown and rotten Great Cleon will give you many strong sons

Dany found herself bereft of words but little Missandei came to her rescue Did his first wife give him sons

The envoy looked at her unhappily Great Cleon has three daughters by his first wife Two of his newer wives are with child But he means to put all of them aside if the Mother of Dragons will consent to wed him

How noble of him said Dany I will consider all you’ve said my lord She gave orders that Ghael be given chambers for the night somewhere lower in the pyramid

All my victories turn to dross in my hands she thought Whatever I do all I make is death and horror When word of what had befallen Astapor reached the streets as it surely would tens of thousands of newly freed Meereenese slaves would doubtless decide to follow her when she went west for fear of what awaited them if they stayed    yet it might well be that worse would await them on the march Even if she emptied every granary in the city and left Meereen to starve how could she feed so many The way before her was fraught with hardship bloodshed and danger Ser Jorah had warned her of that He’d warned her of so many things    he’d    No I will not think of Jorah Mormont Let him keep a little longer I shall see this trader captain she announced Perhaps he would have some better tidings

That proved to be a forlorn hope The master of the Indigo Star was Qartheen so he wept copiously when asked about Astapor The city bleeds Dead men rot unburied in the streets each pyramid is an armed camp and the markets have neither food nor slaves for sale And the poor children King Cleaver’s thugs have seized every highborn boy in Astapor to make new Unsullied for the trade though it will be years before they are trained

The thing that surprised Dany most was how unsurprised she was She found herself remembering Eroeh the Lhazarene girl she had once tried to protect and what had happened to her It will be the same in Meereen once I march she thought The slaves from the fighting pits bred and trained to slaughter were already proving themselves unruly and quarrelsome They seemed to think they owned the city now and every man and woman in it Two of them had been among the eight she’d hanged There is no more I can do she told herself What do you want of me Captain

Slaves he said My holds are full to bursting with ivory ambergris zorse hides and other fine goods I would trade them here for slaves to sell in Lys and Volantis

We have no slaves for sale said Dany

My queen Daario stepped forward The riverside is full of Meereenese begging leave to be allowed to sell themselves to this Qartheen They are thicker than the flies

Dany was shocked They want to be slaves

The ones who come are well spoken and gently born sweet queen Such slaves are prized In the Free Cities they will be tutors scribes bed slaves even healers and priests They will sleep in soft beds eat rich foods and dwell in manses Here they have lost all and live in fear and squalor

I see Perhaps it was not so shocking if these tales of Astapor were true Dany thought a moment Any man who wishes to sell himself into slavery may do so Or woman She raised a hand But they may not sell their children nor a man his wife

In Astapor the city took a tenth part of the price each time a slave changed hands Missandei told her

We’ll do the same Dany decided Wars were won with gold as much as swords A tenth part In gold or silver coin or ivory Meereen has no need of saffron cloves or zorse hides

It shall be done as you command glorious queen said Daario My Stormcrows will collect your tenth

If the Stormcrows saw to the collections at least half the gold would somehow go astray Dany knew But the Second Sons were just as bad and the Unsullied were as unlettered as they were incorruptible Records must be kept she said Seek among the freedmen for men who can read write and do sums

His business done the captain of the Indigo Star bowed and took his leave Dany shifted uncomfortably on the ebony bench She dreaded what must come next yet she knew she had put it off too long already Yunkai and Astapor threats of war marriage proposals the march west looming over all    I need my knights I need their swords and I need their counsel Yet the thought of seeing Jorah Mormont again made her feel as if she’d swallowed a spoonful of flies angry agitated sick She could almost feel them buzzing round her belly I am the blood of the dragon I must be strong I must have fire in my eyes when I face them not tears Tell Belwas to bring my knights Dany commanded before she could change her mind My good knights

Strong Belwas was puffing from the climb when he marched them through the doors one meaty hand wrapped tight around each man’s arm Ser Barristan walked with his head held high but Ser Jorah stared at the marble floor as he approached The one is proud the other guilty The old man had shaved off his white beard He looked ten years younger without it But her balding bear looked older than he had They halted before the bench Strong Belwas stepped back and stood with his arms crossed across his scarred chest Ser Jorah cleared his throat Khaleesi   

She had missed his voice so much but she had to be stern Be quiet I will tell you when to speak She stood When I sent you down into the sewers part of me hoped I’d seen the last of you It seemed a fitting end for liars to drown in slavers’ filth I thought the gods would deal with you but instead you returned to me My gallant knights of Westeros an informer and a turncloak My brother would have hanged you both Viserys would have anyway She did not know what Rhaegar would have done I will admit you helped win me this city   

Ser Jorah’s mouth tightened We won you this city We sewer rats
