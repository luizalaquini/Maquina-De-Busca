Sansa threaded her way through the file of gold-cloaked spearmen as Joffrey beckoned her closer It will be battle soon everyone says so

May the gods have mercy on us all

My uncle’s the one who will need mercy but I won’t give him any Joffrey drew his sword The pommel was a ruby cut in the shape of a heart set between a lion’s jaws Three fullers were deeply incised in the blade My new blade Hearteater

He’d owned a sword named Lion’s Tooth once Sansa remembered Arya had taken it from him and thrown it in a river I hope Stannis does the same with this one It is beautifully wrought Your Grace

Bless my steel with a kiss He extended the blade down to her Go on kiss it

He had never sounded more like a stupid little boy Sansa touched her lips to the metal thinking that she would kiss any number of swords sooner than Joffrey The gesture seemed to please him though He sheathed the blade with a flourish You’ll kiss it again when I return and taste my uncle’s blood

Only if one of your Kingsguard kills him for you Three of the White Swords would go with Joffrey and his uncle Ser Meryn Ser Mandon and Ser Osmund Kettleblack Will you lead your knights into battle Sansa asked hoping

I would but my uncle the Imp says my uncle Stannis will never cross the river I’ll command the Three Whores though I’m going to see to the traitors myself The prospect made Joff smile His plump pink lips always made him look pouty Sansa had liked that once but now it made her sick

They say my brother Robb always goes where the fighting is thickest she said recklessly Though he’s older than Your Grace to be sure A man grown

That made him frown I’ll deal with your brother after I’m done with my traitor uncle I’ll gut him with Hearteater you’ll see He wheeled his horse about and spurred toward the gate Ser Meryn and Ser Osmund fell in to his right and left the gold cloaks following four abreast The Imp and Ser Mandon Moore brought up the rear The guards saw them off with off with shouts and cheers When the last was gone a sudden stillness settled over the yard like the hush before a storm

Through the quiet the singing pulled at her Sansa turned toward the sept Two stableboys followed and one of the guards whose watch was ended Others fell in behind them

Sansa had never seen the sept so crowded nor so brightly lit great shafts of rainbow-colored sunlight slanted down through the crystals in the high windows and candles burned on every side their little flames twinkling like stars The Mother’s altar and the Warrior’s swam in light but Smith and Crone and Maid and Father had their worshipers as well and there were even a few flames dancing below the Stranger’s half-human face… for what was Stannis Baratheon if not the Stranger come to judge them Sansa visited each of the Seven in turn lighting a candle at each altar and then found herself a place on the benches between a wizened old washer woman and a boy no older than Rickon dressed in the fine linen tunic of a knight’s son The old woman’s hand was bony and hard with callus the boy’s small and soft but it was good to have someone to hold on to The air was hot and heavy smelling of incense and sweat crystal-kissed and candle-bright it made her dizzy to breathe it

She knew the hymn her mother had taught it to her once a long time ago in Winterfell She joined her voice to theirs

Gentle Mother font of mercy

save our sons from war we pray

stay the swords and stay the arrows

let them know a better day

Gentle Mother strength of women

help our daughters through this fray

soothe the wrath and tame the fury

teach us all a kinder way

Across the city thousands had jammed into the Great Sept of Baelor on Visenya’s Hill and they would be singing too their voices swelling out over the city across the river and up into the sky Surely the gods must hear us she thought

Sansa knew most of the hymns and followed along on those she did not know as best she could She sang along with grizzled old serving men and anxious young wives with serving girls and soldiers cooks and falconers knights and knaves squires and spit boys and nursing mothers She sang with those inside the castle walls and those without sang with all the city She sang for mercy for the living and the dead alike for Bran and Rickon and Robb for her sister Arya and her bastard brother Jon Snow away off on the Wall She sang for her mother and her father for her grandfather Lord Hoster and her uncle Edmure Tully for her friend Jeyne Poole for old drunken King Robert for Septa Mordane and Ser Dontos and Jory Cassel and Maester Luwin for all the brave knights and soldiers who would die today and for the children and the wives who would mourn them and finally toward the end she even sang for Tyrion the Imp and for the Hound He is no true knight but he saved me all the same she told the Mother Save him if you can and gentle the rage inside him

But when the septon climbed on high and called upon the gods to protect and defend their true and noble king Sansa got to her feet The aisles were jammed with people She had to shoulder through while the septon called upon the Smith to lend strength to Joffrey’s sword and shield the Warrior to give him courage the Father to defend him in his need Let his sword break and his shield shatter Sansa thought coldly as she shoved out through the doors let his courage fail him and every man desert him

A few guards paced along on the gatehouse battlements but otherwise the castle seemed empty Sansa stopped and listened Away off she could hear the sounds of battle The singing almost drowned them out but the sounds were there if you had the ears to hear the deep moan of warhorns the creak and thud of catapults flinging stones the splashes and splinterings the crackle of burning pitch and thrum of scorpions loosing their yard-long iron-headed shafts… and beneath it all the cries of dying men

It was another sort of song a terrible song Sansa pulled the hood of her cloak up over her ears and hurried toward Maegor’s Holdfast the castle-within-a-castle where the queen had promised they would all be safe At the foot of the drawbridge she came upon Lady Tanda and her two daughters Falyse had arrived yesterday from Castle Stokeworth with a small troop of soldiers She was trying to coax her sister onto the bridge but Lollys clung to her maid sobbing I don’t want to I don’t want to I don’t want to

The battle is begun Lady Tanda said in a brittle voice
