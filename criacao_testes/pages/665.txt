I’ll hide by the tree He’s probably alone If he bothers me I’ll kill him Go

Hot Pie went and Arya dropped her carrots and drew the stolen sword from over her shoulder She had strapped the sheath across her back the longsword was made for a man grown and it bumped against the ground when she wore it on her hip It’s too heavy besides she thought missing Needle the way she did every time she took this clumsy thing in her hand But it was a sword and she could kill with it that was enough

Lightfoot she moved to the big old willow that grew beside the bend in the road and went to one knee in the grass and mud within the veil of trailing branches You old gods she prayed as the singer’s voice grew louder you tree gods hide me and make him go past Then a horse whickered and the song broke off suddenly He’s heard she knew but maybe he’s alone or if he’s not maybe they’ll be as scared of us as we are of them

Did you hear that a man’s voice said There’s something behind that wall I would say

Aye replied a second voice deeper What do you think it might be Archer

Two then Arya bit her lip She could not see them from where she knelt on account of the willow But she could hear

A bear A third voice or the first one again

A lot of meat on a bear the deep voice said A lot of fat as well in fall Good to eat if it’s cooked up right

Could be a wolf Maybe a lion

With four feet you think Or two

Makes no matter Does it

Not so I know Archer what do you mean to do with all them arrows

Drop a few shafts over the wall Whatever’s hiding back there will come out quick enough watch and see

What if it’s some honest man back there though Or some poor woman with a little babe at her breast

An honest man would come out and show us his face Only an outlaw would skulk and hide

Aye that’s so Go on and loose your shafts then

Arya sprang to her feet Don’t She showed them her sword There were three she saw Only three Syrio could fight more than three and she had Hot Pie and Gendry to stand with her maybe But they’re boys and these are men

They were men afoot travel-stained and mud-specked She knew the singer by the woodharp he cradled against his jerkin as a mother might cradle a babe A small man fifty from the look of him he had a big mouth a sharp nose and thinning brown hair His faded greens were mended here and there with old leather patches and he wore a brace of throwing knives on his hip and a woodman’s axe slung across his back

The man beside him stood a good foot taller and had the look of a soldier A longsword and dirk hung from his studded leather belt rows of overlapping steel rings were sewn onto his shirt and his head was covered by a black iron halfhelm shaped like a cone He had bad teeth and a bushy brown beard but it was his hooded yellow cloak that drew the eye Thick and heavy stained here with grass and there with blood frayed along the bottom and patched with deerskin on the right shoulder the greatcloak gave the big man the look of some huge yellow bird

The last of the three was a youth as skinny as his longbow if not quite as tall Red-haired and freckled he wore a studded brigantine high boots fingerless leather gloves and a quiver on his back His arrows were fletched with grey goose feathers and six of them stood in the ground before him like a little fence

The three men looked at her standing there in the road with her blade in hand Then the singer idly plucked a string Boy he said put up that sword now unless you’re wanting to be hurt It’s too big for you lad and besides Anguy here could put three shafts through you before you could hope to reach us

He could not Arya said and I’m a girl

So you are The singer bowed My pardons

You go on down the road Just walk right past here and you keep on singing so we’ll know where you are Go away and leave us be and I won’t kill you

The freckle-faced archer laughed Lem she won’t kill us did you hear

I heard said Lem the big soldier with the deep voice

Child said the singer put up that sword and we’ll take you to a safe place and get some food in that belly There are wolves in these parts and lions and worse things No place for a little girl to be wandering alone
