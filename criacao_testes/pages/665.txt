116 For these things I weep mine eye mine eye runneth down with
water because the comforter that should relieve my soul is far from
me my children are desolate because the enemy prevailed

117 Zion spreadeth forth her hands and there is none to comfort her
the LORD hath commanded concerning Jacob that his adversaries should
be round about him Jerusalem is as a menstruous woman among them

118 The LORD is righteous for I have rebelled against his
commandment hear I pray you all people and behold my sorrow my
virgins and my young men are gone into captivity

119 I called for my lovers but they deceived me my priests and mine
elders gave up the ghost in the city while they sought their meat to
relieve their souls

120 Behold O LORD for I am in distress my bowels are troubled
mine heart is turned within me for I have grievously rebelled abroad
the sword bereaveth at home there is as death

121 They have heard that I sigh there is none to comfort me all
mine enemies have heard of my trouble they are glad that thou hast
done it thou wilt bring the day that thou hast called and they shall
be like unto me

122 Let all their wickedness come before thee and do unto them as
thou hast done unto me for all my transgressions for my sighs are
many and my heart is faint

21 How hath the LORD covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his
anger and cast down from heaven unto the earth the beauty of Israel
and remembered not his footstool in the day of his anger  22 The
LORD hath swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob and hath not
pitied he hath thrown down in his wrath the strong holds of the
daughter of Judah he hath brought them down to the ground he hath
polluted the kingdom and the princes thereof

23 He hath cut off in his fierce anger all the horn of Israel he
hath drawn back his right hand from before the enemy and he burned
against Jacob like a flaming fire which devoureth round about

24 He hath bent his bow like an enemy he stood with his right hand
as an adversary and slew all that were pleasant to the eye in the
tabernacle of the daughter of Zion he poured out his fury like fire

25 The LORD was as an enemy he hath swallowed up Israel he hath
swallowed up all her palaces he hath destroyed his strong holds and
hath increased in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation

26 And he hath violently taken away his tabernacle as if it were of
a garden he hath destroyed his places of the assembly the LORD hath
caused the solemn feasts and sabbaths to be forgotten in Zion and
hath despised in the indignation of his anger the king and the priest

27 The LORD hath cast off his altar he hath abhorred his sanctuary
he hath given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces
they have made a noise in the house of the LORD as in the day of a
solemn feast

28 The LORD hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of
Zion he hath stretched out a line he hath not withdrawn his hand
from destroying therefore he made the rampart and the wall to lament
they languished together

29 Her gates are sunk into the ground he hath destroyed and broken
her bars her king and her princes are among the Gentiles the law is
no more her prophets also find no vision from the LORD

210 The elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground and keep
silence they have cast up dust upon their heads they have girded
themselves with sackcloth the virgins of Jerusalem hang down their
heads to the ground

211 Mine eyes do fail with tears my bowels are troubled my liver is
poured upon the earth for the destruction of the daughter of my
people because the children and the sucklings swoon in the streets of
the city

212 They say to their mothers Where is corn and wine when they
swooned as the wounded in the streets of the city when their soul was
poured out into their mothers bosom

213 What thing shall I take to witness for thee what thing shall I
liken to thee O daughter of Jerusalem what shall I equal to thee
that I may comfort thee O virgin daughter of Zion for thy breach is
great like the sea who can heal thee  214 Thy prophets have seen
vain and foolish things for thee and they have not discovered thine
iniquity to turn away thy captivity but have seen for thee false
burdens and causes of banishment

215 All that pass by clap their hands at thee they hiss and wag
their head at the daughter of Jerusalem saying Is this the city that
men call The perfection of beauty The joy of the whole earth  216
All thine enemies have opened their mouth against thee they hiss and
gnash the teeth they say We have swallowed her up certainly this is
the day that we looked for we have found we have seen it

217 The LORD hath done that which he had devised he hath fulfilled
