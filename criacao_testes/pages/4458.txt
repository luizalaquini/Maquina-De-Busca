A lordling down from the Trident says your father’s men burned his keep raped his wife and killed all his peasants

I believe they call that war Tyrion smelled Gregor Clegane’s work or that of Ser Amory Lorch or his father’s other pet hellhound the Qohorik What does he want of Joffrey

New peasants Bronn said He walked all this way to sing how loyal he is and beg for recompense

I’ll make time for him on the morrow Whether truly loyal or merely desperate a compliant river lord might have his uses See that he’s given a comfortable chamber and a hot meal Send him a new pair of boots as well good ones courtesy of King Joffrey A show of generosity never hurt

Bronn gave a curt nod There’s also a great gaggle of bakers butchers and greengrocers clamoring to be heard

I told them last time I have nothing to give them Only a thin trickle of food was coming into King’s Landing most of it earmarked for castle and garrison Prices had risen sickeningly high on greens roots flour and fruit and Tyrion did not want to think about what sorts of flesh might be going into the kettles of the pot-shops down in Flea Bottom Fish he hoped They still had the river and the sea    at least until Lord Stannis sailed

They want protection Last night a baker was roasted in his own oven The mob claimed he charged too much for bread

Did he

He’s not apt to deny it

They didn’t eat him did they

Not that I’ve heard

Next time they will Tyrion said grimly I give them what protection I can The gold cloaks—

They claim there were gold cloaks in the mob Bronn said They’re demanding to speak to the king himself

Fools Tyrion had sent them off with regrets his nephew would send them off with whips and spears He was half-tempted to allow it    but no he dare not Soon or late some enemy would march on King’s Landing and the last thing he wanted was willing traitors within the city walls Tell them King Joffrey shares their fears and will do all he can for them

They want bread not promises

If I give them bread today on the morrow I’ll have twice as many at the gates Who else

A black brother down from the Wall The steward says he brought some rotted hand in a jar

Tyrion smiled wanly I’m surprised no one ate it I suppose I ought to see him It’s not Yoren perchance

No Some knight Thorne

Ser Alliser Thorne Of all the black brothers he’d met on the Wall Tyrion Lannister had liked Ser Alliser Thorne the least A bitter mean-spirited man with too great a sense of his own worth Come to think on it I don’t believe I care to see Ser Alliser just now Find him a snug cell where no one has changed the rushes in a year and let his hand rot a little more

Bronn snorted laughter and went his way while Tyrion struggled up the serpentine steps As he limped across the outer yard he heard the portcullis rattling up His sister and a large party were waiting by the main gate

Mounted on her white palfrey Cersei towered high above him a goddess in green Brother she called out not warmly The queen had not been pleased by the way he’d dealt with Janos Slynt

Your Grace Tyrion bowed politely You look lovely this morning Her crown was gold her cloak ermine Her retinue sat their mounts behind her Ser Boros Blount of the Kingsguard wearing white scale and his favorite scowl Ser Balon Swann bow slung from his silver-inlay saddle Lord Gyles Rosby his wheezing cough worse than ever Hallyne the Pyromancer of the Alchemists’ Guild and the queen’s newest favorite their cousin Ser Lancel Lannister her late husband’s squire upjumped to knight at his widow’s insistence Vylarr and twenty guardsmen rode escort Where are you bound this day sister Tyrion asked

I’m making a round of the gates to inspect the new scorpions and spitfires I would not have it thought that all of us are as indifferent to the city’s defense as you seem to be Cersei fixed him with those clear green eyes of hers beautiful even in their contempt I am informed that Renly Baratheon has marched from Highgarden He is making his way up the roseroad with all his strength behind him

Varys gave me the same report

He could be here by the full moon

Not at his present leisurely pace Tyrion assured her He feasts every night in a different castle and holds court at every crossroads he passes

And every day more men rally to his banners His host is now said to be a hundred thousand strong

That seems rather high

He has the power of Storm’s End and Highgarden behind him you little fool Cersei snapped down at him All the Tyrell bannermen but for the Redwynes and you have me to thank for that So long as I hold those poxy twins of his Lord Paxter will squat on the Arbor and count himself fortunate to be out of it

A pity you let the Knight of Flowers slip through your pretty fingers Still Renly has other concerns besides us Our father at Harrenhal Robb Stark at Riverrun    were I he I would do much as he is doing Make my progress flaunt my power for the realm to see watch wait Let my rivals contend while I bide my own sweet time If Stark defeats us the south will fall into Renly’s hands like a windfall from the gods and he’ll not have lost a man And if it goes the other way he can descend on us while we are weakened

Cersei was not appeased I want you to make Father bring his army to King’s Landing

Where it will serve no purpose but to make you feel safe When have I ever been able to make Father do anything

She ignored the question And when do you plan to free Jaime He’s worth a hundred of you

Tyrion grinned crookedly Don’t tell Lady Stark I beg you We don’t have a hundred of me to trade

Father must have been mad to send you You’re worse than useless The queen jerked on her reins and wheeled her palfrey around She rode out the gate at a brisk trot ermine cloak streaming behind her Her retinue hastened after

In truth Renly Baratheon did not frighten Tyrion half so much as his brother Stannis did Renly was beloved of the commons but he had never before led men in war Stannis was otherwise hard cold inexorable If only they had some way of knowing what was happening on Dragonstone    but not one of the fisherfolk he had paid to spy out the island had ever returned and even the informers the eunuch claimed to have placed in Stannis’s household had been ominously silent The striped hulls of Lysene war galleys had been seen offshore though and Varys had reports from Myr of sellsail captains taking service with Dragonstone If Stannis attacks by sea while his brother Renly storms the gates they’ll soon be mounting Joffrey’s head on a spike Worse mine will be beside him A depressing thought He ought to make plans to get Shae safely out of the city should the worst seem likely

Podrick Payne stood at the door of his solar studying the floor He’s inside he announced to Tyrion’s belt buckle Your solar My lord Sorry

Tyrion sighed Look at me Pod It unnerves me when you talk to my codpiece especially when I’m not wearing one Who is inside my solar

Lord Littlefinger Podrick managed a quick look at his face then hastily dropped his eyes I meant Lord Petyr Lord Baelish The master of coin

You make him sound a crowd The boy hunched down as if struck making Tyrion feel absurdly guilty

Lord Petyr was seated on his window seat languid and elegant in a plush plum-colored doublet and a yellow satin cape one gloved hand resting on his knee The king is fighting hares with a crossbow he said The hares are winning Come see

Tyrion had to stand on his toes to get a look A dead hare lay on the ground below another long ears twitching was about to expire from the bolt in his side Spent quarrels lay strewn across the hard-packed earth like straws scattered by a storm Now Joff shouted The gamesman released the hare he was holding and he went bounding off Joffrey jerked the trigger on the crossbow The bolt missed by two feet The hare stood on his hind legs and twitched his nose at the king Cursing Joff spun the wheel to winch back his string but the animal was gone before he was loaded Another The gamesman reached into the hutch This one made a brown streak against the stones while Joffrey’s hurried shot almost took Ser Preston in the groin

Littlefinger turned away Boy are you fond of potted hare he asked Podrick Payne

Pod stared at the visitor’s boots lovely things of red-dyed leather ornamented with black scrollwork To eat my lord

Invest in pots Littlefinger advised Hares will soon overrun the castle We’ll be eating hare thrice a day

Better than rats on a skewer said Tyrion Pod leave us Unless Lord Petyr would care for some refreshment

Thank you but no Littlefinger flashed his mocking smile Drink with the dwarf it’s said and you wake up walking the Wall Black brings out my unhealthy pallor

Have no fear my lord Tyrion thought it’s not the Wall I have in mind for you He seated himself in a high chair piled with cushions and said You look very elegant today my lord

I’m wounded I strive to look elegant every day
