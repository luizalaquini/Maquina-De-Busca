Bella turned to Arya Don’t he like girls

Arya shrugged He’s just stupid He likes to polish helmets and beat on swords with hammers

Oh Bella tugged her gown back over her shoulder and went to talk with Jack-Be-Lucky Before long she was sitting in his lap giggling and drinking wine from his cup Greenbeard had two girls one on each knee Anguy had vanished with his freckle-faced wench and Lem was gone as well Tom Sevenstrings sat by the fire singing The Maids that Bloom in Spring Arya sipped at the cup of watered wine the red-haired woman had allowed her listening Across the square the dead men were rotting in their crow cages but inside the Peach everyone was jolly Except it seemed to her that some of them were laughing too hard somehow

It would have been a good time to sneak away and steal a horse but Arya couldn’t see how that would help her She could only ride as far as the city gates That captain would never let me pass and if he did Harwin would come after me or that Huntsman with his dogs She wished she had her map so she could see how far Stoney Sept was from Riverrun

By the time her cup was empty Arya was yawning Gendry hadn’t come back Tom Sevenstrings was singing Two Hearts that Beat as One and kissing a different girl at the end of every verse In the corner by the window Lem and Harwin sat talking to red-haired Tansy in low voices …spent the night in Jaime’s cell she heard the woman say Her and this other wench the one who slew Renly All three o’ them together and come the morn Lady Catelyn cut him loose for love She gave a throaty chuckle

It’s not true Arya thought She never would She felt sad and angry and lonely all at once

An old man sat down beside her Well aren’t you a pretty little peach His breath smelled near as foul as the dead men in the cages and his little pig eyes were crawling up and down her Does my sweet peach have a name

For half a heartbeat she forgot who she was supposed to be She wasn’t any peach but she couldn’t be Arya Stark either not here with some smelly drunk she did not know I’m…

She’s my sister Gendry put a heavy hand on the old man’s shoulder and squeezed Leave her be

The man turned spoiling for a quarrel but when he saw Gendry’s size he thought better of it Your sister is she What kind of brother are you I’d never bring no sister of mine to the Peach that I wouldn’t He got up from the bench and moved off muttering in search of a new friend

Why did you say that Arya hopped to her feet You’re not my brother

That’s right he said angrily I’m too bloody lowborn to be kin to m’lady high

Arya was taken aback by the fury in his voice That’s not the way I meant it

Yes it is He sat down on the bench cradling a cup of wine between his hands Go away I want to drink this wine in peace Then maybe I’ll go find that black-haired girl and ring her bell for her

But…

I said go away M’lady

Arya whirled and left him there A stupid bullheaded bastard boy that’s all he is He could ring all the bells he wanted it was nothing to her

Their sleeping room was at the top of the stairs under the eaves Maybe the Peach had no lack of beds but there was only one to spare for the likes of them It was a big bed though It filled the whole room just about and the musty straw-stuffed mattress looked large enough for all of them Just now though she had it to herself Her real clothes were hanging from a peg on the wall between Gendry’s stuff and Lem’s Arya took off the linen and lace pulled her tunic over her head climbed up into the bed and burrowed under the blankets Queen Cersei she whispered into the pillow King Joffrey Ser Ilyn Ser Meryn Dunsen Raff and Polliver The Tickler the Hound and Ser Gregor the Mountain She liked to mix up the order of the names sometimes It helped her remember who they were and what they’d done Maybe some of them are dead she thought Maybe they’re in iron cages someplace and the crows are picking out their eyes

Sleep came as quick as she closed her eyes She dreamed of wolves that night stalking through a wet wood with the smell of rain and rot and blood thick in the air Only they were good smells in the dream and Arya knew she had nothing to fear She was strong and swift and fierce and her pack was all around her her brothers and her sisters They ran down a frightened horse together tore its throat out and feasted And when the moon broke through the clouds she threw back her head and howled

But when the day came she woke to the barking of dogs

Arya sat up yawning Gendry was stirring on her left and Lem Lemoncloak snoring loudly to her right but the baying outside all but drowned him out There must be half a hundred dogs out there She crawled from under the blankets and hopped over Lem Tom and Jack-Be-Lucky to the window When she opened the shutters wide wind and wet and cold all came flooding in together The day was grey and overcast Down below in the square the dogs were barking running in circles growling and howling There was a pack of them great black mastiffs and lean wolfhounds and black-and-white sheepdogs and kinds Arya did not know shaggy brindled beasts with long yellow teeth Between the inn and the fountain a dozen riders sat astride their horses watching the townsmen open the fat man’s cage and tug his arm until his swollen corpse spilled out onto the ground The dogs were at him at once tearing chunks of flesh off his bones

Arya heard one of the riders laugh Here’s your new castle you bloody Lannister bastard he said A little snug for the likes o’ you but we’ll squeeze you in never fret Beside him a prisoner sat sullen with coils of hempen rope tight around his wrists Some of the townsmen were throwing dung at him but he never flinched You’ll rot in them cages his captor was shouting The crows will be picking out your eyes while we’re spending all that good Lannister gold o’ yours And when them crows are done we’ll send what’s left o’ you to your bloody brother Though I doubt he’ll know you

The noise had woken half the Peach Gendry squeezed into the window beside Arya and Tom stepped up behind them naked as his name day What’s all that bloody shouting Lem complained from bed A man’s trying to get some bloody sleep

Where’s Greenbeard Tom asked him

Abed with Tansy Lem said Why

Best find him Archer too The Mad Huntsman’s come back with another man for the cages

Lannister said Arya I heard him say Lannister
