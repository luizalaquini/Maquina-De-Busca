He looked about the Round Room once more White wool hangings covered the walls and there was a white shield and two crossed longswords mounted above the hearth The chair behind the table was old black oak with cushions of blanched cowhide the leather worn thin Worn by the bony arse of Barristan the Bold and Ser Gerold Hightower before him by Prince Aemon the Dragonknight Ser Ryam Redwyne and the Demon of Darry by Ser Duncan the Tall and the Pale Griffin Alyn Connington How could the Kingslayer belong in such exalted company

Yet here he was

The table itself was old weirwood pale as bone carved in the shape of a huge shield supported by three white stallions By tradition the Lord Commander sat at the top of the shield and the brothers three to a side on the rare occasions when all seven were assembled The book that rested by his elbow was massive two feet tall and a foot and a half wide a thousand pages thick fine white vellum bound between covers of bleached white leather with gold hinges and fastenings The Book of the Brothers was its formal name but more often it was simply called the White Book

Within the White Book was the history of the Kingsguard Every knight who’d ever served had a page to record his name and deeds for all time On the top left-hand corner of each page was drawn the shield the man had carried at the time he was chosen inked in rich colors Down in the bottom right corner was the shield of the Kingsguard snow-white empty pure The upper shields were all different the lower shields were all the same In the space between were written the facts of each man’s life and service The heraldic drawings and illuminations were done by septons sent from the Great Sept of Baelor three times a year but it was the duty of the Lord Commander to keep the entries up to date

My duty now Once he learned to write with his left hand that is The White Book was well behind The deaths of Ser Mandon Moore and Ser Preston Greenfield needed to be entered and the brief bloody Kingsguard service of Sandor Clegane as well New pages must be started for Ser Balon Swann Ser Osmund Kettleblack and the Knight of Flowers I will need to summon a septon to draw their shields

Ser Barristan Selmy had preceded Jaime as Lord Commander The shield atop his page showed the arms of House Selmy three stalks of wheat yellow on a brown field Jaime was amused though unsurprised to find that Ser Barristan had taken the time to record his own dismissal before leaving the castle





Ser Barristan of House Selmy Firstborn son of Ser Lyonel Selmy of Harvest Hall Served as squire to Ser Manfred Swann Named the Bold in his 10th year when he donned borrowed armor to appear as a mystery knight in the tourney at Blackhaven where he was defeated and unmasked by Duncan Prince of Dragonflies Knighted in his 16th year by King Aegon V Targaryen after performing great feats of prowess as a mystery knight in the winter tourney at King’s Landing defeating Prince Duncan the Small and Ser Duncan the Tall Lord Commander of the Kingsguard Slew Maelys the Monstrous last of the Blackfyre Pretenders in single combat during the War of the Ninepenny Kings Defeated Lormelle Long Lance and Cedrik Storm the Bastard of Bronzegate Named to the Kingsguard in his 23rd year by Lord Commander Ser Gerold Hightower Defended the passage against all challengers in the tourney of the Silver Bridge Victor in the mêlée at Maidenpool Brought King Aerys II to safety during the Defiance of Duskendale despite an arrow wound in the chest Avenged the murder of his Sworn Brother Ser Gwayne Gaunt Rescued Lady Jeyne Swann and her septa from the Kingswood Brotherhood defeating Simon Toyne and the Smiling Knight and slaying the former In the Oldtown tourney defeated and unmasked the mystery knight Blackshield revealing him as the Bastard of Uplands Sole champion of Lord Steffon’s tourney at Storm’s End whereat he unhorsed Lord Robert Baratheon Prince Oberyn Martell Lord Leyton Hightower Lord Jon Connington Lord Jason Mallister and Prince Rhaegar Targaryen Wounded by arrow spear and sword at the Battle of the Trident whilst fighting beside his Sworn Brothers and Rhaegar Prince of Dragonstone Pardoned and named Lord Commander of the Kingsguard by King Robert I Baratheon Served in the honor guard that brought Lady Cersei of House Lannister to King’s Landing to wed King Robert Led the attack on Old Wyk during Balon Greyjoy’s Rebellion Champion of the tourney at King’s Landing in his 57th year Dismissed from service by King Joffrey I Baratheon in his 61st year for reasons of advanced age





The earlier part of Ser Barristan’s storied career had been entered by Ser Gerold Hightower in a big forceful hand Selmy’s own smaller and more elegant writing took over with the account of his wounding on the Trident

Jaime’s own page was scant by comparison





Ser Jaime of House Lannister Firstborn son of Lord Tywin and Lady Joanna of Casterly Rock Served against the Kingswood Brotherhood as squire to Lord Sumner Crakehall Knighted in his 15th year by Ser Arthur Dayne of the Kingsguard for valor in the field Chosen for the Kingsguard in his 15th year by King Aerys II Targaryen During the Sack of King’s Landing slew King Aerys II at the foot of the Iron Throne Thereafter known as the Kingslayer Pardoned for his crime by King Robert I Baratheon Served in the honor guard that brought his sister the Lady Cersei Lannister to King’s Landing to wed King Robert Champion in the tourney held at King’s Landing on the occasion of their wedding





Summed up like that his life seemed a rather scant and mingy thing Ser Barristan could have recorded a few of his other tourney victories at least And Ser Gerold might have written a few more words about the deeds he’d performed when Ser Arthur Dayne broke the Kingswood Brotherhood He had saved Lord Sumner’s life as Big Belly Ben was about to smash his head in though the outlaw had escaped him And he’d held his own against the Smiling Knight though it was Ser Arthur who slew him What a fight that was and what a foe The Smiling Knight was a madman cruelty and chivalry all jumbled up together but he did not know the meaning of fear And Dayne with Dawn in hand… the outlaw’s longsword had so many notches by the end that Ser Arthur had stopped to let him fetch a new one It’s that white sword of yours I want the robber knight told him as they resumed though he was bleeding from a dozen wounds by then Then you shall have it ser the Sword of the Morning replied and made an end of it

The world was simpler in those days Jaime thought and men as well as swords were made of finer steel Or was it only that he had been fifteen They were all in their graves now the Sword of the Morning and the Smiling Knight the White Bull and Prince Lewyn Ser Oswell Whent with his black humor earnest Jon Darry Simon Toyne and his Kingswood Brotherhood bluff old Sumner Crakehall And me that boy I was… when did he die I wonder When I donned the white cloak When I opened Aerys’s throat That boy had wanted to be Ser Arthur Dayne but someplace along the way he had become the Smiling Knight instead

When he heard the door open he closed the White Book and stood to receive his Sworn Brothers Ser Osmund Kettleblack was the first to arrive He gave Jaime a grin as if they were old brothers-in-arms Ser Jaime he said had you looked like this t’other night I’d have known you at once

Would you indeed Jaime doubted that The servants had bathed him shaved him and washed and brushed his hair When he looked in a glass he no longer saw the man who had crossed the riverlands with Brienne… but he did not see himself either His face was thin and hollow and he had lines under his eyes I look like some old man Stand by your seat ser

Kettleblack complied The other Sworn Brothers filed in one by one Sers Jaime said in a formal tone when all five had assembled who guards the king

My brothers Ser Osney and Ser Osfryd Ser Osmund replied

And my brother Ser Garlan said the Knight of Flowers

Will they keep him safe

They will my lord
