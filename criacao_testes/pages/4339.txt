Unfortunately either of these expressions can exceed 1 leading to an
unstable filter
The value of k cited earlier is the geometric mean of these two
expressions and since it is a correlation coefficient must be less than 1

Another possibility is to minimize the expected value of the sum of the
squares of the upper and lower outputs

Taking expected values and setting the derivative with respect to k to zero

This also is guaranteed to be less than 1 and has given good results
in speech analysis systems

Figure 614 shows the implementation of a single section of an analysis
lattice
FC Figure 614
The signals x sup + n and x sup - n-1 are fed to a
correlator which produces a suitable value for k
This value is used to calculate the output of the lattice section
and hence the input to the next lattice section
The reflection coefficient needs to be low-pass filtered because it will
only be transmitted to the synthesizer occasionally say every 20 msec and so a
short-term average is required

One implementation of the correlator is shown in Figure 615 Kang 1974

This calculates the value of k given by the last equation above and does it
by summing and differencing the two
signals x sup + n and x sup - n-1 squaring the results to give

Before these are divided to give the final coefficient k they are
individually low-pass filtered
While some rather complex schemes have been proposed
based upon Kalman filter theory eg Matsui

It is sometimes useful to think of linear prediction as a kind of
curve-fitting technique
Figure 616 illustrates how four samples of a speech signal can predict
the next one
FC Figure 616
In essence a curve is drawn through four points
to predict the position of the fifth and only the prediction error
is actually transmitted  Now if the order of linear prediction
is high enough at least 10 and if the coefficients are chosen
