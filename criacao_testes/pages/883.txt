the bond of iniquity

824 Then answered Simon and said Pray ye to the LORD for me that
none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me

825 And they when they had testified and preached the word of the
Lord returned to Jerusalem and preached the gospel in many villages
of the Samaritans

826 And the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip saying Arise and
go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto
Gaza which is desert

827 And he arose and went and behold a man of Ethiopia an eunuch
of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians who had the
charge of all her treasure and had come to Jerusalem for to worship
828 Was returning and sitting in his chariot read Esaias the
prophet

829 Then the Spirit said unto Philip Go near and join thyself to
this chariot

830 And Philip ran thither to him and heard him read the prophet
Esaias and said Understandest thou what thou readest  831 And he
said How can I except some man should guide me And he desired
Philip that he would come up and sit with him

832 The place of the scripture which he read was this He was led as
a sheep to the slaughter and like a lamb dumb before his shearer so
opened he not his mouth 833 In his humiliation his judgment was
taken away and who shall declare his generation for his life is
taken from the earth

834 And the eunuch answered Philip and said I pray thee of whom
speaketh the prophet this of himself or of some other man  835
Then Philip opened his mouth and began at the same scripture and
preached unto him Jesus

836 And as they went on their way they came unto a certain water
and the eunuch said See here is water what doth hinder me to be
baptized  837 And Philip said If thou believest with all thine
heart thou mayest

And he answered and said I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of
God

838 And he commanded the chariot to stand still and they went down
both into the water both Philip and the eunuch and he baptized him

839 And when they were come up out of the water the Spirit of the
Lord caught away Philip that the eunuch saw him no more and he went
on his way rejoicing

840 But Philip was found at Azotus and passing through he preached
in all the cities till he came to Caesarea

91 And Saul yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the
disciples of the Lord went unto the high priest 92 And desired of
him letters to Damascus to the synagogues that if he found any of
this way whether they were men or women he might bring them bound
unto Jerusalem

93 And as he journeyed he came near Damascus and suddenly there
shined round about him a light from heaven 94 And he fell to the
earth and heard a voice saying unto him Saul Saul why persecutest
thou me  95 And he said Who art thou Lord And the Lord said I am
Jesus whom thou persecutest it is hard for thee to kick against the
pricks

96 And he trembling and astonished said Lord what wilt thou have me
to do And the Lord said unto him Arise and go into the city and it
shall be told thee what thou must do

97 And the men which journeyed with him stood speechless hearing a
voice but seeing no man

98 And Saul arose from the earth and when his eyes were opened he
saw no man but they led him by the hand and brought him into
Damascus

99 And he was three days without sight and neither did eat nor
drink

910 And there was a certain disciple at Damascus named Ananias and
to him said the Lord in a vision Ananias And he said Behold I am
here Lord

911 And the Lord said unto him Arise and go into the street which
is called Straight and enquire in the house of Judas for one called
Saul of Tarsus for behold he prayeth 912 And hath seen in a
vision a man named Ananias coming in and putting his hand on him
that he might receive his sight

913 Then Ananias answered Lord I have heard by many of this man
how much evil he hath done to thy saints at Jerusalem 914 And here
he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on thy

915 But the Lord said unto him Go thy way for he is a chosen vessel
unto me to bear my name before the Gentiles and kings and the
