I never did I would have died for him

You will Ser Loras drew his longsword

It was not me

Emmon Cuy swore it was with his dying breath

He was outside the tent he never saw—

There was no one in the tent but you and Lady Stark Do you claim that old woman could cut through hardened steel

There was a shadow I know how mad it sounds but… I was helping Renly into his armor and the candles blew out and there was blood everywhere It was Stannis Lady Catelyn said His… his shadow I had no part in it on my honor…

You have no honor Draw your sword I won’t have it said that I slew you while your hand was empty

Jaime stepped between them Put the sword away ser

Ser Loras edged around him Are you a craven as well as a killer Brienne Is that why you ran with his blood on your hands Draw your sword woman

Best hope she doesn’t Jaime blocked his path again Or it’s like to be your corpse we carry out The wench is as strong as Gregor Clegane though not so pretty

This is no concern of yours Ser Loras shoved him aside

Jaime grabbed the boy with his good hand and yanked him around I am the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard you arrogant pup Your commander so long as you wear that white cloak Now sheathe your bloody sword or I’ll take it from you and shove it up some place even Renly never found

The boy hesitated half a heartbeat long enough for Ser Balon Swann to say Do as the Lord Commander says Loras Some of the gold cloaks drew their steel then and that made some Dreadfort men do the same Splendid thought Jaime no sooner do I climb down off my horse than we have a bloodbath in the yard

Ser Loras Tyrell slammed his sword back into its sheath

That wasn’t so difficult was it

I want her arrested Ser Loras pointed Lady Brienne I charge you with the murder of Lord Renly Baratheon

For what it’s worth said Jaime the wench does have honor More than I have seen from you And it may even be she’s telling it true I’ll grant you she’s not what you’d call clever but even my horse could come up with a better lie if it was a lie she meant to tell As you insist however… Ser Balon escort Lady Brienne to a tower cell and hold her there under guard And find some suitable quarters for Steelshanks and his men until such time as my father can see them

Yes my lord

Brienne’s big blue eyes were full of hurt as Balon Swann and a dozen gold cloaks led her away You ought to be blowing me kisses wench he wanted to tell her Why must they misunderstand every bloody thing he did Aerys It all grows from Aerys Jaime turned his back on the wench and strode across the yard

Another knight in white armor was guarding the doors of the royal sept a tall man with a black beard broad shoulders and a hooked nose When he saw Jaime he gave a sour smile and said And where do you think you’re going

Into the sept Jaime lifted his stump to point That one right there I mean to see the queen

Her Grace is in mourning And why would she be wanting to see the likes of you

Because I’m her lover and the father of her murdered son he wanted to say Who in seven hells are you

A knight of the Kingsguard and you’d best learn some respect cripple or I’ll have that other hand and leave you to suck up your porridge of a morning

I am the queen’s brother ser

The white knight thought that funny Escaped have you And grown a bit as well m’lord
