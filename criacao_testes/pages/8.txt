1129 And Abram and Nahor took them wives the name of Abrams wife
was Sarai and the name of Nahors wife Milcah the daughter of

1130 But Sarai was barren she had no child

son and Sarai his daughter in law his son Abrams wife and they
went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees to go into the land of
Canaan and they came unto Haran and dwelt there

1132 And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years and Terah
died in Haran

121 Now the LORD had said unto Abram Get thee out of thy country
and from thy kindred and from thy fathers house unto a land that I
will shew thee 122 And I will make of thee a great nation and I
will bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a
blessing 123 And I will bless them that bless thee and curse him
that curseth thee and in thee shall all families of the earth be
blessed

gotten in Haran and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan
and into the land of Canaan they came

126 And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem unto
the plain of Moreh And the Canaanite was then in the land

127 And the LORD appeared unto Abram and said Unto thy seed will I
give this land and there builded he an altar unto the LORD who
appeared unto him

128 And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel
and pitched his tent having Bethel on the west and Hai on the east
and there he builded an altar unto the LORD and called upon the name
of the LORD

129 And Abram journeyed going on still toward the south

1210 And there was a famine in the land and Abram went down into
Egypt to sojourn there for the famine was grievous in the land

1211 And it came to pass when he was come near to enter into Egypt
that he said unto Sarai his wife Behold now I know that thou art a
fair woman to look upon 1212 Therefore it shall come to pass when
the Egyptians shall see thee that they shall say This is his wife
and they will kill me but they will save thee alive

1213 Say I pray thee thou art my sister that it may be well with
me for thy sake and my soul shall live because of thee
