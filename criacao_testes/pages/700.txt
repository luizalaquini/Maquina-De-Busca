3431 And ye my flock the flock of my pasture are men and I am your
God saith the Lord GOD

351 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me saying 352 Son of
man set thy face against mount Seir and prophesy against it 353
And say unto it Thus saith the Lord GOD Behold O mount Seir I am
against thee and I will stretch out mine hand against thee and I
will make thee most desolate

354 I will lay thy cities waste and thou shalt be desolate and thou
shalt know that I am the LORD

355 Because thou hast had a perpetual hatred and hast shed the blood
of the children of Israel by the force of the sword in the time of
their calamity in the time that their iniquity had an end 356
Therefore as I live saith the Lord GOD I will prepare thee unto
blood and blood shall pursue thee sith thou hast not hated blood
even blood shall pursue thee

357 Thus will I make mount Seir most desolate and cut off from it
him that passeth out and him that returneth

358 And I will fill his mountains with his slain men in thy hills
and in thy valleys and in all thy rivers shall they fall that are
slain with the sword

359 I will make thee perpetual desolations and thy cities shall not
return and ye shall know that I am the LORD

3510 Because thou hast said These two nations and these two
countries shall be mine and we will possess it whereas the LORD was
there 3511 Therefore as I live saith the Lord GOD I will even do
according to thine anger and according to thine envy which thou hast
used out of thy hatred against them and I will make myself known
among them when I have judged thee

3512 And thou shalt know that I am the LORD and that I have heard
all thy blasphemies which thou hast spoken against the mountains of
Israel saying They are laid desolate they are given us to consume

3513 Thus with your mouth ye have boasted against me and have
multiplied your words against me I have heard them

3514 Thus saith the Lord GOD When the whole earth rejoiceth I will
make thee desolate

3515 As thou didst rejoice at the inheritance of the house of Israel
because it was desolate so will I do unto thee thou shalt be
desolate O mount Seir and all Idumea even all of it and they shall
know that I am the LORD

361 Also thou son of man prophesy unto the mountains of Israel and
say Ye mountains of Israel hear the word of the LORD 362 Thus
saith the Lord GOD Because the enemy hath said against you Aha even
the ancient high places are ours in possession 363 Therefore
prophesy and say Thus saith the Lord GOD Because they have made you
desolate and swallowed you up on every side that ye might be a
possession unto the residue of the heathen and ye are taken up in the
lips of talkers and are an infamy of the people 364 Therefore ye
mountains of Israel hear the word of the Lord GOD Thus saith the
Lord GOD to the mountains and to the hills to the rivers and to the
valleys to the desolate wastes and to the cities that are forsaken
which became a prey and derision to the residue of the heathen that
are round about 365 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD Surely in the
fire of my jealousy have I spoken against the residue of the heathen
and against all Idumea which have appointed my land into their
possession with the joy of all their heart with despiteful minds to
cast it out for a prey

366 Prophesy therefore concerning the land of Israel and say unto
the mountains and to the hills to the rivers and to the valleys
Thus saith the Lord GOD Behold I have spoken in my jealousy and in
my fury because ye have borne the shame of the heathen 367
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD I have lifted up mine hand Surely
the heathen that are about you they shall bear their shame

368 But ye O mountains of Israel ye shall shoot forth your
branches and yield your fruit to my people of Israel for they are at
hand to come

369 For behold I am for you and I will turn unto you and ye shall
be tilled and sown 3610 And I will multiply men upon you all the
house of Israel even all of it and the cities shall be inhabited
and the wastes shall be builded 3611 And I will multiply upon you
man and beast and they shall increase and bring fruit and I will
settle you after your old estates and will do better unto you than at
your beginnings and ye shall know that I am the LORD

3612 Yea I will cause men to walk upon you even my people Israel
and they shall possess thee and thou shalt be their inheritance and
thou shalt no more henceforth bereave them of men

3613 Thus saith the Lord GOD Because they say unto you Thou land
devourest up men and hast bereaved thy nations 3614 Therefore thou
shalt devour men no more neither bereave thy nations any more saith
the Lord GOD

3615 Neither will I cause men to hear in thee the shame of the
heathen any more neither shalt thou bear the reproach of the people
