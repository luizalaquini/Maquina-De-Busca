1430 But when he saw the wind boisterous he was afraid and
beginning to sink he cried saying Lord save me

1431 And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand and caught him
and said unto him O thou of little faith wherefore didst thou doubt
1432 And when they were come into the ship the wind ceased

1433 Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him saying
Of a truth thou art the Son of God

1434 And when they were gone over they came into the land of
Gennesaret

1435 And when the men of that place had knowledge of him they sent
out into all that country round about and brought unto him all that
were diseased 1436 And besought him that they might only touch the
hem of his garment and as many as touched were made perfectly whole

151 Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees which were of
Jerusalem saying 152 Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition
of the elders for they wash not their hands when they eat bread

153 But he answered and said unto them Why do ye also transgress the
commandment of God by your tradition  154 For God commanded saying
Honour thy father and mother and He that curseth father or mother
let him die the death

155 But ye say Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother It
is a gift by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me 156 And
honour not his father or his mother he shall be free Thus have ye
made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition

157 Ye hypocrites well did Esaias prophesy of you saying 158 This
people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth and honoureth me with
their lips but their heart is far from me

159 But in vain they do worship me teaching for doctrines the
commandments of men

1510 And he called the multitude and said unto them Hear and
understand 1511 Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man
but that which cometh out of the mouth this defileth a man

1512 Then came his disciples and said unto him Knowest thou that
the Pharisees were offended after they heard this saying  1513 But
he answered and said Every plant which my heavenly Father hath not
planted shall be rooted up

1514 Let them alone they be blind leaders of the blind And if the
blind lead the blind both shall fall into the ditch

1515 Then answered Peter and said unto him Declare unto us this
parable

1516 And Jesus said Are ye also yet without understanding  1517 Do
not ye yet understand that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth
into the belly and is cast out into the draught  1518 But those
things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart and
they defile the man

1519 For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts murders adulteries
fornications thefts false witness blasphemies 1520 These are the
things which defile a man but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not
a man

1521 Then Jesus went thence and departed into the coasts of Tyre and
Sidon

1522 And behold a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts and
cried unto him saying Have mercy on me O Lord thou son of David
my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil

1523 But he answered her not a word And his disciples came and
besought him saying Send her away for she crieth after us

1524 But he answered and said I am not sent but unto the lost sheep
of the house of Israel

1525 Then came she and worshipped him saying Lord help me

1526 But he answered and said It is not meet to take the childrens
bread and to cast it to dogs

1527 And she said Truth Lord yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which
fall from their masters table

1528 Then Jesus answered and said unto her O woman great is thy
faith be it unto thee even as thou wilt And her daughter was made
whole from that very hour

1529 And Jesus departed from thence and came nigh unto the sea of
Galilee and went up into a mountain and sat down there

1530 And great multitudes came unto him having with them those that
were lame blind dumb maimed and many others and cast them down at
Jesus feet and he healed them 1531 Insomuch that the multitude
wondered when they saw the dumb to speak the maimed to be whole the
lame to walk and the blind to see and they glorified the God of
Israel
