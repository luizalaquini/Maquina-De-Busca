One of his crewmen pulled him back to his feet Captain ser the Hart is ours It was true Davos saw Most of the enemy were dead dying or yielded He took off his helm wiped blood from his face and made his way back to his own ship trodding carefully on boards slimy with men’s guts Matthos lent him a hand to help him back over the rail

For those few instants Black Betha and White Hart were the calm eye in the midst of the storm Queen Alysanne and Lady of Silk still locked together were a ranging green inferno drifting downriver and dragging pieces of Lady’s Shame One of the Myrish galleys had slammed into them and was now afire as well Cat was taking on men from the fast-sinking Courageous The captain of Dragonsbane had driven her between two quays ripping out her bottom her crew poured ashore with the archers and men-at-arms to join the assault on the walls Red Raven rammed was slowly listing Stag of the Sea was fighting fires and boarders both but the fiery heart had been raised over Joffrey’s Loyal Man Fury her proud bow smashed in by a boulder was engaged with Godsgrace He saw Lord Velaryon’s Pride of Driftmark crash between two Lannister river runners overturning one and lighting the other up with fire arrows On the south bank knights were leading their mounts aboard the cogs and some of the smaller galleys were already making their way across laden with men-at-arms They had to thread cautiously between sinking ships and patches of drifting wildfire The whole of King Stannis’s fleet was in the river now save for Salladhor Saan’s Lyseni Soon enough they would control the Blackwater Ser Imry will have his victory Davos thought and Stannis will bring his host across but gods be good the cost of this…

Captain ser Matthos touched his shoulder

It was Swordfish her two banks of oars lifting and falling She had never brought down her sails and some burning pitch had caught in her rigging The flames spread as Davos watched creeping out over ropes and sails until she trailed a head of yellow flame Her ungainly iron ram fashioned after the likeness of the fish from which she took her name parted the surface of the river before her Directly ahead drifting toward her and swinging around to present a tempting plump target was one of the Lannister hulks floating low in the water Slow green blood was leaking out between her boards

When he saw that Davos Seaworth’s heart stopped beating

No he said No NOOOOOOOO Above the roar and crash of battle no one heard him but Matthos Certainly the captain of the Swordfish did not intent as he was on finally spearing something with his ungainly fat sword The Swordfish went to battle speed Davos lifted his maimed hand to clutch at the leather pouch that held his fingerbones

With a grinding splintering tearing crash Swordfish split the rotted hulk asunder She burst like an overripe fruit but no fruit had ever screamed that shattering wooden scream From inside her Davos saw green gushing from a thousand broken jars poison from the entrails of a dying beast glistening shining spreading across the surface of the river…

Back water he roared Away Get us off her back water back water The grappling lines were cut and Davos felt the deck move under his feet as Black Betha pushed free of White Hart Her oars slid down into the water

Then he heard a short sharp woof as if someone had blown in his ear Half a heartbeat later came the roar The deck vanished beneath him and black water smashed him across the face filling his nose and mouth He was choking drowning Unsure which way was up Davos wrestled the river in blind panic until suddenly he broke the surface He spat out water sucked in air grabbed hold of the nearest chunk of debris and held on

Swordfish and the hulk were gone blackened bodies were floating downstream beside him and choking men clinging to bits of smoking wood Fifty feet high a swirling demon of green flame danced upon the river It had a dozen hands in each a whip and whatever they touched burst into fire He saw Black Betha burning and White Hart and Loyal Man to either side Piety Cat Courageous Sceptre Red Raven Harridan Faithful Fury they had all gone up Kingslander and Godsgrace as well the demon was eating his own Lord Velaryon’s shining Pride of Driftmark was trying to turn but the demon ran a lazy green finger across her silvery oars and they flared up like so many tapers For an instant she seemed to be stroking the river with two banks of long bright torches

The current had him in its teeth by then spinning him around and around He kicked to avoid a floating patch of wildfire My sons Davos thought but there was no way to look for them amidst the roaring chaos Another hulk heavy with wildfire went up behind him The Blackwater itself seemed to boil in its bed and burning spars and burning men and pieces of broken ships filled the air

I’m being swept out into the bay It wouldn’t be as bad there he ought to be able to make shore he was a strong swimmer Salladhor Saan’s galleys would be out in the bay as well Ser Imry had commanded them to stand off…

And then the current turned him about again and Davos saw what awaited him downstream

The chain Gods save us they’ve raised the chain

Where the river broadened out into Blackwater Bay the boom stretched taut a bare two or three feet above the water Already a dozen galleys had crashed into it and the current was pushing others against them Almost all were aflame and the rest soon would be Davos could make out the striped hulls of Salladhor Saan’s ships beyond but he knew he would never reach them A wall of red-hot steel blazing wood and swirling green flame stretched before him The mouth of the Blackwater Rush had turned into the mouth of hell





TYRION

Motionless as a gargoyle Tyrion Lannister hunched on one knee atop a merlon Beyond the Mud Gate and the desolation that had once been the fishmarket and wharves the river itself seemed to have taken fire Half of Stannis’s fleet was ablaze along with most of Joffrey’s The kiss of wildfire turned proud ships into funeral pyres and men into living torches The air was full of smoke and arrows and screams

Downstream commoners and highborn captains alike could see the hot green death swirling toward their rafts and carracks and ferries borne on the current of the Blackwater The long white oars of the Myrish galleys flashed like the legs of maddened centipedes as they fought to come about but it was no good The centipedes had no place to run

A dozen great fires raged under the city walls where casks of burning pitch had exploded but the wildfire reduced them to no more than candles in a burning house their orange and scarlet pennons fluttering insignificantly against the jade holocaust The low clouds caught the color of the burning river and roofed the sky in shades of shifting green eerily beautiful A terrible beauty Like dragonfire Tyrion wondered if Aegon the Conqueror had felt like this as he flew above his Field of Fire

The furnace wind lifted his crimson cloak and beat at his bare face yet he could not turn away He was dimly aware of the gold cloaks cheering from the hoardings He had no voice to join them It was a half victory It will not be enough

He saw another of the hulks he’d stuffed full of King Aerys’s fickle fruits engulfed by the hungry flames A fountain of burning jade rose from the river the blast so bright he had to shield his eyes Plumes of fire thirty and forty feet high danced upon the waters crackling and hissing For a few moments they washed out the screams There were hundreds in the water drowning or burning or doing a little of both

Do you hear them shrieking Stannis Do you see them burning This is your work as much as mine Somewhere in that seething mass of men south of the Blackwater Stannis was watching too Tyrion knew He’d never had his brother Robert’s thirst for battle He would command from the rear from the reserve much as Lord Tywin Lannister was wont to do Like as not he was sitting a warhorse right now clad in bright armor his crown upon his head A crown of red gold Varys says its points fashioned in the shapes of flames

My ships Joffrey’s voice cracked as he shouted up from the wallwalk where he huddled with his guards behind the ramparts The golden circlet of kingship adorned his battle helm My Kingslander’s burning Queen Cersei Loyal Man Look that’s Seaflower there He pointed with his new sword out to where the green flames were licking at Seaflower’s golden hull and creeping up her oars Her captain had turned her upriver but not quickly enough to evade the wildfire

She was doomed Tyrion knew There was no other way If we had not come forth to meet them Stannis would have sensed the trap An arrow could be aimed and a spear even the stone from a catapult but wildfire had a will of its own Once loosed it was beyond the control of mere men It could not be helped he told his nephew Our fleet was doomed in any case

Even from atop the merlon—he had been too short to see over the ramparts so he’d had them boost him up—the flames and smoke and chaos of battle made it impossible for Tyrion to see what was happening downriver under the castle but he had seen it a thousand times in his mind’s eye Bronn would have whipped the oxen into motion the moment Stannis’s flagship passed under the Red Keep the chain was ponderous heavy and the great winches turned but slowly creaking and rumbling The whole of the usurper’s fleet would have passed by the time the first glimmer of metal could be seen beneath the water The links would emerge dripping wet some glistening with mud link by link by link until the whole great chain stretched taut King Stannis had rowed his fleet up the Blackwater but he would not row out again
