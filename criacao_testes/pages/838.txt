The Hound made a sound that might have been a laugh There’s old deaf women in Lannisport complaining of the din I’ll warrant I’d heard Walder Frey’s eyes were failing but no one mentioned his bloody ears

Arya found herself wishing it were day If the sun was out and the wind was blowing she would have been able to see the banners better She would have looked for the direwolf of Stark or maybe the Cerwyn battleaxe or the Glover fist But in the gloom of night all the colors looked grey The rain had dwindled down to a fine drizzle almost a mist but an earlier downpour had left the banners wet as dishrags sodden and unreadable

A hedge of wagons and carts had been drawn up along the perimeter to make a crude wooden wall against any attack That was where the guards stopped them The lantern their sergeant carried shed enough light for Arya to see that his cloak was a pale pink spotted with red teardrops The men under him had the Leech Lord’s badge sewn over their hearts the flayed man of the Dreadfort Sandor Clegane gave them the same tale he’d used on the outriders but the Bolton sergeant was a harder sort of nut than Ser Donnel Haigh had been Salt pork’s no fit meat for a lord’s wedding feast he said scornfully

Got pickled pigs’ feet too ser

Not for the feast you don’t The feast’s half done And I’m a northman not some milksuck southron knight

I was told to see the steward or the cook…

Castle’s closed The lordlings are not to be disturbed The sergeant considered a moment You can unload by the feast tents there He pointed with a mailed hand Ale makes a man hungry and old Frey won’t miss a few pigs’ feet He don’t have the teeth for such anyhow Ask for Sedgekins he’ll know what’s to be done with you He barked a command and his men rolled one of the wagons aside for them to enter

The Hound’s whip spurred the team toward the tents No one seemed to pay them any mind They splashed past rows of brightly colored pavilions their walls of wet silk lit up like magic lanterns by lamps and braziers inside pink and gold and green they glimmered striped and fretty and chequy emblazoned with birds and beasts chevrons and stars wheels and weapons Arya spotted a yellow tent with six acorns on its panels three over two over one Lord Smallwood she knew remembering Acorn Hall so far away and the lady who’d said she was pretty

But for every shimmering silk pavilion there were two dozen of felt or canvas opaque and dark There were barracks tents too big enough to shelter two score footsoldiers though even those were dwarfed by the three great feast tents The drinking had been going on for hours it seemed Arya heard shouted toasts and the clash of cups mixed in with all the usual camp sounds horses whinnying and dogs barking wagons rumbling through the dark laughter and curses the clank and clatter of steel and wood The music grew still louder as they approached the castle but under that was a deeper darker sound the river the swollen Green Fork growling like a lion in its den

Arya twisted and turned trying to look everywhere at once hoping for a glimpse of a direwolf badge for a tent done up in grey and white for a face she knew from Winterfell All she saw were strangers She stared at a man relieving himself in the reeds but he wasn’t Alebelly She saw a half-dressed girl burst from a tent laughing but the tent was pale blue not grey like she’d thought at first and the man who went running after her wore a treecat on his doublet not a wolf Beneath a tree four archers were slipping waxed strings over the notches of their longbows but they were not her father’s archers A maester crossed their path but he was too young and thin to be Maester Luwin Arya gazed up at the Twins their high tower windows glowing softly wherever a light was burning Through the haze of rain the castles looked spooky and mysterious like something from one of Old Nan’s tales but they weren’t Winterfell

The press was thickest at the feast tents The wide flaps were tied back and men were pushing in and out with drinking horns and tankards in their hands some with camp followers Arya glanced inside as the Hound drove past the first of the three and saw hundreds of men crowding the benches and jostling around the casks of mead and ale and wine There was hardly room to move inside but none of them seemed to mind At least they were warm and dry Cold wet Arya envied them Some were even singing The fine misty rain was steaming all around the door from the heat escaping from inside Here’s to Lord Edmure and Lady Roslin she heard a voice shout They all drank and someone yelled Here’s to the Young Wolf and Queen Jeyne

Who is Queen Jeyne Arya wondered briefly The only queen she knew was Cersei

Firepits had been dug outside the feast tents sheltered beneath rude canopies of woven wood and hides that kept the rain out so long as it fell straight down The wind was blowing off the river though so the drizzle came in anyway enough to make the fires hiss and swirl Serving men were turning joints of meat on spits above the flames The smells made Arya’s mouth water Shouldn’t we stop she asked Sandor Clegane There’s northmen in the tents She knew them by their beards by their faces by their cloaks of bearskin and sealskin by their half-heard toasts and the songs they sang Karstarks and Umbers and men of the mountain clans I bet there are Winterfell men too Her father’s men the Young Wolf’s men the direwolves of Stark

Your brother will be in the castle he said Your mother too You want them or not

Yes she said What about Sedgekins The sergeant had told them to ask for Sedgekins

Sedgekins can bugger himself with a hot poker Clegane shook out his whip and sent it hissing through the soft rain to bite at a horse’s flank It’s your bloody brother I want





Catelyn


The drums were pounding pounding pounding and her head with them Pipes wailed and flutes trilled from the musicians’ gallery at the foot of the hall fiddles screeched horns blew the skins skirled a lively tune but the drumming drove them all The sounds echoed off the rafters whilst the guests ate drank and shouted at one another below Walder Frey must be deaf as a stone to call this music Catelyn sipped a cup of wine and watched Jinglebell prance to the sounds of Alysanne At least she thought it was meant to be Alysanne With these players it might as easily have been The Bear and the Maiden Fair

Outside the rain still fell but within the Twins the air was thick and hot A fire roared in the hearth and rows of torches burned smokily from iron sconces on the walls Yet most of the heat came off the bodies of the wedding guests jammed in so thick along the benches that every man who tried to lift his cup poked his neighbor in the ribs

Even on the dais they were closer than Catelyn would have liked She had been placed between Ser Ryman Frey and Roose Bolton and had gotten a good noseful of both Ser Ryman drank as if Westeros was about to run short of wine and sweated it all out under his arms He had bathed in lemonwater she judged but no lemon could mask so much sour sweat Roose Bolton had a sweeter smell to him yet no more pleasant He sipped hippocras in preference to wine or mead and ate but little

Catelyn could not fault him for his lack of appetite The wedding feast began with a thin leek soup followed by a salad of green beans onions and beets river pike poached in almond milk mounds of mashed turnips that were cold before they reached the table jellied calves’ brains and a leche of stringy beef It was poor fare to set before a king and the calves’ brains turned Catelyn’s stomach Yet Robb ate it uncomplaining and her brother was too caught up with his bride to pay much attention

You would never guess Edmure complained of Roslin all the way from Riverrun to the Twins Husband and wife ate from a single plate drank from a single cup and exchanged chaste kisses between sips Most of the dishes Edmure waved away She could not blame him for that She remembered little of the food served at her own wedding feast Did I even taste it Or spend the whole time gazing at Ned’s face wondering who he was

Poor Roslin’s smile had a fixed quality to it as if someone had sewn it onto her face Well she is a maid wedded but the bedding’s yet to come No doubt she’s as terrified as I was Robb was seated between Alyx Frey and Fair Walda two of the more nubile Frey maidens At the wedding feast I hope you will not refuse to dance with my daughters Walder Frey had said It would please an old man’s heart His heart should be well pleased then Robb had done his duty like a king He had danced with each of the girls with Edmure’s bride and the eighth Lady Frey with the widow Ami and Roose Bolton’s wife Fat Walda with the pimply twins Serra and Sarra even with Shirei Lord Walder’s youngest who must have been all of six Catelyn wondered whether the Lord of the Crossing would be satisfied or if he would find cause for complaint in all the other daughters and granddaughters who had not had a turn with the king Your sisters dance very well she said to Ser Ryman Frey trying to be pleasant

They’re aunts and cousins Ser Ryman drank a swallow of wine the sweat trickling down his cheek into his beard
