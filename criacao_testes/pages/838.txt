sit down quickly and write fifty

167 Then said he to another And how much owest thou And he said An
hundred measures of wheat And he said unto him Take thy bill and
write fourscore

168 And the lord commended the unjust steward because he had done
wisely for the children of this world are in their generation wiser
than the children of light

169 And I say unto you Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of
unrighteousness that when ye fail they may receive you into
everlasting habitations

1610 He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in
much and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much

1611 If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous
mammon who will commit to your trust the true riches  1612 And if
ye have not been faithful in that which is another mans who shall
give you that which is your own  1613 No servant can serve two
masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or else
he will hold to the one and despise the other Ye cannot serve God
and mammon

1614 And the Pharisees also who were covetous heard all these
things and they derided him

1615 And he said unto them Ye are they which justify yourselves
before men but God knoweth your hearts for that which is highly
esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God

1616 The law and the prophets were until John since that time the
kingdom of God is preached and every man presseth into it

1617 And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass than one tittle
of the law to fail

1618 Whosoever putteth away his wife and marrieth another
committeth adultery and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from
her husband committeth adultery

1619 There was a certain rich man which was clothed in purple and
fine linen and fared sumptuously every day 1620 And there was a
certain beggar named Lazarus which was laid at his gate full of
sores 1621 And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from
the rich mans table moreover the dogs came and licked his sores

1622 And it came to pass that the beggar died and was carried by
the angels into Abrahams bosom the rich man also died and was
buried 1623 And in hell he lift up his eyes being in torments and
seeth Abraham afar off and Lazarus in his bosom

1624 And he cried and said Father Abraham have mercy on me and
send Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool
my tongue for I am tormented in this flame

1625 But Abraham said Son remember that thou in thy lifetime
receivedst thy good things and likewise Lazarus evil things but now
he is comforted and thou art tormented

1626 And beside all this between us and you there is a great gulf
fixed so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot neither
can they pass to us that would come from thence

1627 Then he said I pray thee therefore father that thou wouldest
send him to my fathers house 1628 For I have five brethren that he
may testify unto them lest they also come into this place of torment

1629 Abraham saith unto him They have Moses and the prophets let
them hear them

1630 And he said Nay father Abraham but if one went unto them from
the dead they will repent

1631 And he said unto him If they hear not Moses and the prophets
neither will they be persuaded though one rose from the dead

171 Then said he unto the disciples It is impossible but that
offences will come but woe unto him through whom they come  172 It
were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and
he cast into the sea than that he should offend one of these little
ones

173 Take heed to yourselves If thy brother trespass against thee
rebuke him and if he repent forgive him

174 And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day and seven
times in a day turn again to thee saying I repent thou shalt
forgive him

175 And the apostles said unto the Lord Increase our faith

176 And the Lord said If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed ye
might say unto this sycamine tree Be thou plucked up by the root and
be thou planted in the sea and it should obey you

177 But which of you having a servant plowing or feeding cattle
will say unto him by and by when he is come from the field Go and
sit down to meat  178 And will not rather say unto him Make ready
