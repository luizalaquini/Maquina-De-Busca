818 And the LORD said unto Joshua Stretch out the spear that is in
thy hand toward Ai for I will give it into thine hand And Joshua
stretched out the spear that he had in his hand toward the city

819 And the ambush arose quickly out of their place and they ran as
soon as he had stretched out his hand and they entered into the city
and took it and hasted and set the city on fire

820 And when the men of Ai looked behind them they saw and behold
the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven and they had no power to
flee this way or that way and the people that fled to the wilderness
turned back upon the pursuers

821 And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the
city and that the smoke of the city ascended then they turned again
and slew the men of Ai

822 And the other issued out of the city against them so they were
in the midst of Israel some on this side and some on that side and
they smote them so that they let none of them remain or escape

823 And the king of Ai they took alive and brought him to Joshua

824 And it came to pass when Israel had made an end of slaying all
the inhabitants of Ai in the field in the wilderness wherein they
chased them and when they were all fallen on the edge of the sword
until they were consumed that all the Israelites returned unto Ai
and smote it with the edge of the sword

825 And so it was that all that fell that day both of men and
women were twelve thousand even all the men of Ai

826 For Joshua drew not his hand back wherewith he stretched out the
spear until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai

827 Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for a prey
unto themselves according unto the word of the LORD which he
commanded Joshua

828 And Joshua burnt Ai and made it an heap for ever even a
desolation unto this day

829 And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until eventide and as
soon as the sun was down Joshua commanded that they should take his
carcase down from the tree and cast it at the entering of the gate of
the city and raise thereon a great heap of stones that remaineth
unto this day

830 Then Joshua built an altar unto the LORD God of Israel in mount
Ebal 831 As Moses the servant of the LORD commanded the children of
Israel as it is written in the book of the law of Moses an altar of
whole stones over which no man hath lift up any iron and they
offered thereon burnt offerings unto the LORD and sacrificed peace
offerings

832 And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses
which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel

833 And all Israel and their elders and officers and their judges
stood on this side the ark and on that side before the priests the
Levites which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD as well the
stranger as he that was born among them half of them over against
mount Gerizim and half of them over against mount Ebal as Moses the
servant of the LORD had commanded before that they should bless the
people of Israel

834 And afterward he read all the words of the law the blessings and
cursings according to all that is written in the book of the law

835 There was not a word of all that Moses commanded which Joshua
read not before all the congregation of Israel with the women and
the little ones and the strangers that were conversant among them

91 And it came to pass when all the kings which were on this side
Jordan in the hills and in the valleys and in all the coasts of the
great sea over against Lebanon the Hittite and the Amorite the
Canaanite the Perizzite the Hivite and the Jebusite heard thereof
92 That they gathered themselves together to fight with Joshua and
with Israel with one accord

93 And when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done unto
Jericho and to Ai 94 They did work wilily and went and made as if
they had been ambassadors and took old sacks upon their asses and
wine bottles old and rent and bound up 95 And old shoes and
clouted upon their feet and old garments upon them and all the bread
of their provision was dry and mouldy

96 And they went to Joshua unto the camp at Gilgal and said unto
him and to the men of Israel We be come from a far country now
therefore make ye a league with us

97 And the men of Israel said unto the Hivites Peradventure ye dwell
among us and how shall we make a league with you  98 And they said
unto Joshua We are thy servants And Joshua said unto them Who are
ye and from whence come ye  99 And they said unto him From a very
far country thy servants are come because of the name of the LORD thy
God for we have heard the fame of him and all that he did in Egypt
910 And all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites that were
beyond Jordan to Sihon king of Heshbon and to Og king of Bashan
