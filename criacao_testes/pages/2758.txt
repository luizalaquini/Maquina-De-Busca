1122 Benaiah the son of Jehoiada the son of a valiant man of
Kabzeel who had done many acts he slew two lionlike men of Moab
also he went down and slew a lion in a pit in a snowy day

1123 And he slew an Egyptian a man of great stature five cubits
high and in the Egyptians hand was a spear like a weavers beam and
he went down to him with a staff and plucked the spear out of the
Egyptians hand and slew him with his own spear

1124 These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada and had the name
among the three mighties

1125 Behold he was honourable among the thirty but attained not to
the first three and David set him over his guard

1126 Also the valiant men of the armies were Asahel the brother of
Joab Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem 1127 Shammoth the
Harorite Helez the Pelonite 1128 Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite
Abiezer the Antothite 1129 Sibbecai the Hushathite Ilai the
Ahohite 1130 Maharai the Netophathite Heled the son of Baanah the

Gizonite Jonathan the son of Shage the Hararite 1135 Ahiam the son
of Sacar the Hararite Eliphal the son of Ur 1136 Hepher the

brother the Tizite 1146 Eliel the Mahavite and Jeribai and
Joshaviah the sons of Elnaam and Ithmah the Moabite 1147 Eliel
and Obed and Jasiel the Mesobaite

121 Now these are they that came to David to Ziklag while he yet
kept himself close because of Saul the son of Kish and they were
among the mighty men helpers of the war

122 They were armed with bows and could use both the right hand and
the left in hurling stones and shooting arrows out of a bow even of
Sauls brethren of Benjamin

123 The chief was Ahiezer then Joash the sons of Shemaah the
Gibeathite and Jeziel and Pelet the sons of Azmaveth and Berachah
and Jehu the Antothite

124 And Ismaiah the Gibeonite a mighty man among the thirty and
over the thirty and Jeremiah and Jahaziel and Johanan and Josabad
the Gederathite 125 Eluzai and Jerimoth and Bealiah and
Shemariah and Shephatiah the Haruphite 126 Elkanah and Jesiah and
Azareel and Joezer and Jashobeam the Korhites 127 And Joelah and
Zebadiah the sons of Jeroham of Gedor

128 And of the Gadites there separated themselves unto David into the
hold to the wilderness men of might and men of war fit for the
battle that could handle shield and buckler whose faces were like
the faces of lions and were as swift as the roes upon the mountains
129 Ezer the first Obadiah the second Eliab the third 1210
Mishmannah the fourth Jeremiah the fifth 1211 Attai the sixth
Eliel the seventh 1212 Johanan the eighth Elzabad the ninth 1213
Jeremiah the tenth Machbanai the eleventh

1214 These were of the sons of Gad captains of the host one of the
least was over an hundred and the greatest over a thousand

1215 These are they that went over Jordan in the first month when it
had overflown all his banks and they put to flight all them of the
valleys both toward the east and toward the west

1216 And there came of the children of Benjamin and Judah to the hold
unto David

1217 And David went out to meet them and answered and said unto
them If ye be come peaceably unto me to help me mine heart shall be
knit unto you but if ye be come to betray me to mine enemies seeing
there is no wrong in mine hands the God of our fathers look thereon
and rebuke it

1218 Then the spirit came upon Amasai who was chief of the captains
and he said Thine are we David and on thy side thou son of Jesse
peace peace be unto thee and peace be to thine helpers for thy God
helpeth thee

Then David received them and made them captains of the band

1219 And there fell some of Manasseh to David when he came with the
Philistines against Saul to battle but they helped them not for the
lords of the Philistines upon advisement sent him away saying He
will fall to his master Saul to the jeopardy of our heads

1220 As he went to Ziklag there fell to him of Manasseh Adnah and
Jozabad and Jediael and Michael and Jozabad and Elihu and
Zilthai captains of the thousands that were of Manasseh
