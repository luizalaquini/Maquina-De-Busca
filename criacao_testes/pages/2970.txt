82 I would lead thee and bring thee into my mothers house who
would instruct me I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine of the
juice of my pomegranate

83 His left hand should be under my head and his right hand should
embrace me

84 I charge you O daughters of Jerusalem that ye stir not up nor
awake my love until he please

85 Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness leaning upon her
beloved I raised thee up under the apple tree there thy mother
brought thee forth there she brought thee forth that bare thee

86 Set me as a seal upon thine heart as a seal upon thine arm for
love is strong as death jealousy is cruel as the grave the coals
thereof are coals of fire which hath a most vehement flame

87 Many waters cannot quench love neither can the floods drown it
if a man would give all the substance of his house for love it would
utterly be contemned

88 We have a little sister and she hath no breasts what shall we do
for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for  89 If she be
a wall we will build upon her a palace of silver and if she be a
door we will inclose her with boards of cedar

810 I am a wall and my breasts like towers then was I in his eyes
as one that found favour

811 Solomon had a vineyard at Baalhamon he let out the vineyard unto
keepers every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand
pieces of silver

812 My vineyard which is mine is before me thou O Solomon must
have a thousand and those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred

813 Thou that dwellest in the gardens the companions hearken to thy
voice cause me to hear it

814 Make haste my beloved and be thou like to a roe or to a young
hart upon the mountains of spices




The Book of the Prophet Isaiah


11 The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz which he saw concerning
Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah Jotham Ahaz and Hezekiah
kings of Judah

12 Hear O heavens and give ear O earth for the LORD hath spoken
I have nourished and brought up children and they have rebelled
against me

13 The ox knoweth his owner and the ass his masters crib but
Israel doth not know my people doth not consider

14 Ah sinful nation a people laden with iniquity a seed of
evildoers children that are corrupters they have forsaken the LORD
they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger they are gone
away backward

15 Why should ye be stricken any more ye will revolt more and more
the whole head is sick and the whole heart faint

16 From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness
in it but wounds and bruises and putrifying sores they have not
been closed neither bound up neither mollified with ointment

17 Your country is desolate your cities are burned with fire your
land strangers devour it in your presence and it is desolate as
overthrown by strangers

18 And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard as a
lodge in a garden of cucumbers as a besieged city

19 Except the LORD of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant we
should have been as Sodom and we should have been like unto Gomorrah

110 Hear the word of the LORD ye rulers of Sodom give ear unto the
law of our God ye people of Gomorrah

111 To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me
saith the LORD I am full of the burnt offerings of rams and the fat
of fed beasts and I delight not in the blood of bullocks or of
lambs or of he goats

112 When ye come to appear before me who hath required this at your
hand to tread my courts  113 Bring no more vain oblations incense
is an abomination unto me the new moons and sabbaths the calling of
assemblies I cannot away with it is iniquity even the solemn
meeting

114 Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth they are
a trouble unto me I am weary to bear them
