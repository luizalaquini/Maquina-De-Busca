Well you’re nothing but a bastard boy Or maybe he was only pretending to be a bastard boy What’s your true name

Gendry he said like he wasn’t quite sure

Don’t see why no one wants neither o’ you Yoren said but they can’t have you regardless You ride them two coursers First sight of a gold cloak make for the Wall like a dragon’s on your tail The rest o’ us don’t mean spit to them

Except for you Arya pointed out That man said he’d take your head too

Well as to that Yoren said if he can get it off my shoulders he’s welcome to it





JON

Sam Jon called softly

The air smelled of paper and dust and years Before him tall wooden shelves rose up into dimness crammed with leatherbound books and bins of ancient scrolls A faint yellow glow filtered through the stacks from some hidden lamp Jon blew out the taper he carried preferring not to risk an open flame amidst so much old dry paper Instead he followed the light wending his way down the narrow aisles beneath barrel-vaulted ceilings All in black he was a shadow among shadows dark of hair long of face grey of eye Black moleskin gloves covered his hands the right because it was burned the left because a man felt half a fool wearing only one glove

Samwell Tarly sat hunched over a table in a niche carved into the stone of the wall The glow came from the lamp hung over his head He looked up at the sound of Jon’s steps

Have you been here all night

Have I Sam looked startled

You didn’t break your fast with us and your bed hadn’t been slept in Rast suggested that maybe Sam had deserted but Jon never believed it Desertion required its own sort of courage and Sam had little enough of that

Is it morning Down here there’s no way to know

Sam you’re a sweet fool Jon said You’ll miss that bed when we’re sleeping on the cold hard ground I promise you

Sam yawned Maester Aemon sent me to find maps for the Lord Commander I never thought… Jon the books have you ever seen their like There are thousands

He gazed about him The library at Winterfell has more than a hundred Did you find the maps

Oh yes Sam’s hand swept over the table fingers plump as sausages indicating the clutter of books and scrolls before him A dozen at the least He unfolded a square of parchment The paint has faded but you can see where the mapmaker marked the sites of wildling villages and there’s another book… where is it now I was reading it a moment ago He shoved some scrolls aside to reveal a dusty volume bound in rotted leather This he said reverently is the account of a journey from the Shadow Tower all the way to Lorn Point on the Frozen Shore written by a ranger named Redwyn It’s not dated but he mentions a Dorren Stark as King in the North so it must be from before the Conquest Jon they fought giants Redwyn even traded with the children of the forest it’s all here Ever so delicately he turned pages with a finger He drew maps as well see…

Maybe you could write an account of our ranging Sam

He’d meant to sound encouraging but it was the wrong thing to say The last thing Sam needed was to be reminded of what faced them on the morrow He shuffled the scrolls about aimlessly There’s more maps If I had time to search… everything’s a jumble I could set it all to order though I know I could but it would take time… well years in truth

Mormont wanted those maps a little sooner than that Jon plucked a scroll from a bin blew off the worst of the dust A corner flaked off between his fingers as he unrolled it Look this one is crumbling he said frowning over the faded script

Be gentle Sam came around the table and took the scroll from his hand holding it as if it were a wounded animal The important books used to be copied over when they needed them Some of the oldest have been copied half a hundred times probably

Well don’t bother copying that one Twenty-three barrels of pickled cod eighteen jars of fish oil a cask of salt…

An inventory Sam said or perhaps a bill of sale

Who cares how much pickled cod they ate six hundred years ago Jon wondered

I would Sam carefully replaced the scroll in the bin from which Jon had plucked it You can learn so much from ledgers like that truly you can it can tell you how many men were in the Night’s Watch then how they lived what they ate…

They ate food said Jon and they lived as we live

You’d be surprised This vault is a treasure Jon

If you say so Jon was doubtful Treasure meant gold silver and jewels not dust spiders and rotting leather

I do the fat boy blurted He was older than Jon a man grown by law but it was hard to think of him as anything but a boy I found drawings of the faces in the trees and a book about the tongue of the children of the forest… works that even the Citadel doesn’t have scrolls from old Valyria counts of the seasons written by maesters dead a thousand years…

The books will still be here when we return

If we return…

The Old Bear is taking two hundred seasoned men three-quarters of them rangers Qhorin Halfhand will be bringing another hundred brothers from the Shadow Tower You’ll be as safe as if you were back in your lord father’s castle at Horn Hill

Samwell Tarly managed a sad little smile I was never very safe in my father’s castle either

The gods play cruel jests Jon thought Pyp and Toad all a lather to be a part of the great ranging were to remain at Castle Black It was Samwell Tarly the self-proclaimed coward grossly fat timid and near as bad a rider as he was with a sword who must face the haunted forest The Old Bear was taking two cages of ravens so they might send back word as they went Maester Aemon was blind and far too frail to ride with them so his steward must go in his place We need you for the ravens Sam And someone has to help me keep Grenn humble

Sam’s chins quivered You could care for the ravens or Grenn could or anyone he said with a thin edge of desperation in his voice I could show you how You know your letters too you could write down Lord Mormont’s messages as well as I

I’m the Old Bear’s steward I’ll need to squire for him tend his horse set up his tent I won’t have time to watch over birds as well Sam you said the words You’re a brother of the Night’s Watch now

A brother of the Night’s Watch shouldn’t be so scared

We’re all scared We’d be fools if we weren’t Too many rangers had been lost the past two years even Benjen Stark Jon’s uncle They had found two of his uncle’s men in the wood slain but the corpses had risen in the chill of night Jon’s burnt fingers twitched as he remembered He still saw the wight in his dreams dead Othor with the burning blue eyes and the cold black hands but that was the last thing Sam needed to be reminded of There’s no shame in fear my father told me what matters is how we face it Come I’ll help you gather up the maps

Sam nodded unhappily The shelves were so closely spaced that they had to walk single file as they left The vault opened onto one of the tunnels the brothers called the wormwalks winding subterranean passages that linked the keeps and towers of Castle Black under the earth In summer the wormwalks were seldom used save by rats and other vermin but winter was a different matter When the snows drifted forty and fifty feet high and the ice winds came howling out of the north the tunnels were all that held Castle Black together

Soon Jon thought as they climbed He’d seen the harbinger that had come to Maester Aemon with word of summer’s end the great raven of the Citadel white and silent as Ghost He had seen a winter once when he was very young but everyone agreed that it had been a short one and mild This one would be different He could feel it in his bones

The steep stone steps had Sam puffing like a blacksmith’s bellows by the time they reached the surface They emerged into a brisk wind that made Jon’s cloak swirl and snap Ghost was stretched out asleep beneath the wattle-and-daub wall of the granary but he woke when Jon appeared bushy white tail held stiffly upright as he trotted to them

Sam squinted up at the Wall It loomed above them an icy cliff seven hundred feet high Sometimes it seemed to Jon almost a living thing with moods of its own The color of the ice was wont to change with every shift of the light Now it was the deep blue of frozen rivers now the dirty white of old snow and when a cloud passed before the sun it darkened to the pale grey of pitted stone The Wall stretched east and west as far as the eye could see so huge that it shrunk the timbered keeps and stone towers of the castle to insignificance It was the end of the world

And we are going beyond it

The morning sky was streaked by thin grey clouds but the pale red line was there behind them The black brothers had dubbed the wanderer Mormont’s Torch saying only half in jest that the gods must have sent it to light the old man’s way through the haunted forest

The comet’s so bright you can see it by day now Sam said shading his eyes with a fistful of books

Never mind about comets it’s maps the Old Bear wants

Ghost loped ahead of them The grounds seemed deserted this morning with so many rangers off at the brothel in Mole’s Town digging for buried treasure and drinking themselves blind Grenn had gone with them Pyp and Halder and Toad had offered to buy him his first woman to celebrate his first ranging They’d wanted Jon and Sam to come as well but Sam was almost as frightened of whores as he was of the haunted forest and Jon had wanted no part of it Do what you want he told Toad I took a vow

As they passed the sept he heard voices raised in song Some men want whores on the eve of battle and some want gods Jon wondered who felt better afterward The sept tempted him no more than the brothel his own gods kept their temples in the wild places where the weirwoods spread their bone-white branches The Seven have no power beyond the Wall he thought but my gods will be waiting
