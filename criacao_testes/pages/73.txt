Oh please Sansa said I want to see

Septa Mordane spoke up Princess Myrcella will be there my lord and her younger than Lady Sansa All the ladies of the court will be expected at a grand event like this and as the tourney is in your honor it would look queer if your family did not attend

Father looked pained I suppose so Very well I shall arrange a place for you Sansa He saw Arya For both of you

I don’t care about their stupid tourney Arya said She knew Prince Joffrey would be there and she hated Prince Joffrey

Sansa lifted her head It will be a splendid event You shan’t be wanted

Anger flashed across Father’s face Enough Sansa More of that and you will change my mind I am weary unto death of this endless war you two are fighting You are sisters I expect you to behave like sisters is that understood

Sansa bit her lip and nodded Arya lowered her face to stare sullenly at her plate She could feel tears stinging her eyes She rubbed them away angrily determined not to cry

The only sound was the clatter of knives and forks Pray excuse me her father announced to the table I find I have small appetite tonight He walked from the hall

After he was gone Sansa exchanged excited whispers with Jeyne Poole Down the table Jory laughed at a joke and Hullen started in about horseflesh Your warhorse now he may not be the best one for the joust Not the same thing oh no not the same at all The men had heard it all before Desmond Jacks and Hullen’s son Harwin shouted him down together and Porther called for more wine

No one talked to Arya She didn’t care She liked it that way She would have eaten her meals alone in her bedchamber if they let her Sometimes they did when Father had to dine with the king or some lord or the envoys from this place or that place The rest of the time they ate in his solar just him and her and Sansa That was when Arya missed her brothers most She wanted to tease Bran and play with baby Rickon and have Robb smile at her She wanted Jon to muss up her hair and call her little sister and finish her sentences with her But all of them were gone She had no one left but Sansa and Sansa wouldn’t even talk to her unless Father made her

Back at Winterfell they had eaten in the Great Hall almost half the time Her father used to say that a lord needed to eat with his men if he hoped to keep them Know the men who follow you she heard him tell Robb once and let them know you Don’t ask your men to die for a stranger At Winterfell he always had an extra seat set at his own table and every day a different man would be asked to join him One night it would be Vayon Poole and the talk would be coppers and bread stores and servants The next time it would be Mikken and her father would listen to him go on about armor and swords and how hot a forge should be and the best way to temper steel Another day it might be Hullen with his endless horse talk or Septon Chayle from the library or Jory or Ser Rodrik or even Old Nan with her stories

Arya had loved nothing better than to sit at her father’s table and listen to them talk She had loved listening to the men on the benches too to freeriders tough as leather courtly knights and bold young squires grizzled old men-at-arms She used to throw snowballs at them and help them steal pies from the kitchen Their wives gave her scones and she invented names for their babies and played monsters-and-maidens and hide-the-treasure and come-into-my-castle with their children Fat Tom used to call her Arya Underfoot because he said that was where she always was She’d liked that a lot better than Arya Horseface

Only that was Winterfell a world away and now everything was changed This was the first time they had supped with the men since arriving in King’s Landing Arya hated it She hated the sounds of their voices now the way they laughed the stories they told They’d been her friends she’d felt safe around them but now she knew that was a lie They’d let the queen kill Lady that was horrible enough but then the Hound found Mycah Jeyne Poole had told Arya that he’d cut him up in so many pieces that they’d given him back to the butcher in a bag and at first the poor man had thought it was a pig they’d slaughtered And no one had raised a voice or drawn a blade or anything not Harwin who always talked so bold or Alyn who was going to be a knight or Jory who was captain of the guard Not even her father

He was my friend Arya whispered into her plate so low that no one could hear Her ribs sat there untouched grown cold now a thin film of grease congealing beneath them on the plate Arya looked at them and felt ill She pushed away from the table

Pray where do you think you are going young lady Septa Mordane asked

I’m not hungry Arya found it an effort to remember her courtesies May I be excused please she recited stiffly

You may not the septa said You have scarcely touched your food You will sit down and clean your plate

You clean it Before anyone could stop her Arya bolted for the door as the men laughed and Septa Mordane called loudly after her her voice rising higher and higher

Fat Tom was at his post guarding the door to the Tower of the Hand He blinked when he saw Arya rushing toward him and heard the septa’s shouts Here now little one hold on he started to say reaching but Arya slid between his legs and then she was running up the winding tower steps her feet hammering on the stone while Fat Tom huffed and puffed behind her

Her bedchamber was the only place that Arya liked in all of King’s Landing and the thing she liked best about it was the door a massive slab of dark oak with black iron bands When she slammed that door and dropped the heavy crossbar nobody could get into her room not Septa Mordane or Fat Tom or Sansa or Jory or the Hound nobody She slammed it now

When the bar was down Arya finally felt safe enough to cry

She went to the window seat and sat there sniffling hating them all and herself most of all It was all her fault everything bad that had happened Sansa said so and Jeyne too

Fat Tom was knocking on her door Arya girl what’s wrong he called out You in there

No she shouted The knocking stopped A moment later she heard him going away Fat Tom was always easy to fool

Arya went to the chest at the foot of her bed She knelt opened the lid and began pulling her clothes out with both hands grabbing handfuls of silk and satin and velvet and wool and tossing them on the floor It was there at the bottom of the chest where she’d hidden it Arya lifted it out almost tenderly and drew the slender blade from its sheath

Needle

She thought of Mycah again and her eyes filled with tears Her fault her fault her fault If she had never asked him to play at swords with her…
