151 And he saith unto him Verily verily I say unto you Hereafter
ye shall see heaven open and the angels of God ascending and
descending upon the Son of man

21 And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee and the
mother of Jesus was there 22 And both Jesus was called and his
disciples to the marriage

23 And when they wanted wine the mother of Jesus saith unto him
They have no wine

24 Jesus saith unto her Woman what have I to do with thee mine
hour is not yet come

25 His mother saith unto the servants Whatsoever he saith unto you
do it

26 And there were set there six waterpots of stone after the manner
of the purifying of the Jews containing two or three firkins apiece

27 Jesus saith unto them Fill the waterpots with water And they
filled them up to the brim

28 And he saith unto them Draw out now and bear unto the governor
of the feast And they bare it

29 When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made
wine and knew not whence it was but the servants which drew the
water knew the governor of the feast called the bridegroom 210 And
saith unto him Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine
and when men have well drunk then that which is worse but thou hast
kept the good wine until now

211 This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee and
manifested forth his glory and his disciples believed on him

212 After this he went down to Capernaum he and his mother and his
brethren and his disciples and they continued there not many days

213 And the Jews passover was at hand and Jesus went up to
Jerusalem

214 And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves
and the changers of money sitting 215 And when he had made a scourge
of small cords he drove them all out of the temple and the sheep
and the oxen and poured out the changers money and overthrew the
tables 216 And said unto them that sold doves Take these things
hence make not my Fathers house an house of merchandise

217 And his disciples remembered that it was written The zeal of
thine house hath eaten me up

218 Then answered the Jews and said unto him What sign shewest thou
unto us seeing that thou doest these things  219 Jesus answered and
said unto them Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it
up

220 Then said the Jews Forty and six years was this temple in
building and wilt thou rear it up in three days  221 But he spake
of the temple of his body

222 When therefore he was risen from the dead his disciples
remembered that he had said this unto them and they believed the
scripture and the word which Jesus had said

223 Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover in the feast day
many believed in his name when they saw the miracles which he did

224 But Jesus did not commit himself unto them because he knew all
men 225 And needed not that any should testify of man for he knew
what was in man

31 There was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler of the
Jews 32 The same came to Jesus by night and said unto him Rabbi
we know that thou art a teacher come from God for no man can do these
miracles that thou doest except God be with him

33 Jesus answered and said unto him Verily verily I say unto thee
Except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God

34 Nicodemus saith unto him How can a man be born when he is old
can he enter the second time into his mothers womb and be born  35
Jesus answered Verily verily I say unto thee Except a man be born
of water and of the Spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God

36 That which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born
of the Spirit is spirit

37 Marvel not that I said unto thee Ye must be born again

38 The wind bloweth where it listeth and thou hearest the sound
thereof but canst not tell whence it cometh and whither it goeth so
is every one that is born of the Spirit

39 Nicodemus answered and said unto him How can these things be
310 Jesus answered and said unto him Art thou a master of Israel
and knowest not these things  311 Verily verily I say unto thee
We speak that we do know and testify that we have seen and ye
receive not our witness
