58 And David said on that day Whosoever getteth up to the gutter
and smiteth the Jebusites and the lame and the blind that are hated
of Davids soul he shall be chief and captain Wherefore they said
The blind and the lame shall not come into the house

59 So David dwelt in the fort and called it the city of David And
David built round about from Millo and inward

510 And David went on and grew great and the LORD God of hosts was
with him

511 And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David and cedar trees
and carpenters and masons and they built David an house

512 And David perceived that the LORD had established him king over
Israel and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israels
sake

513 And David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem
after he was come from Hebron and there were yet sons and daughters
born to David

514 And these be the names of those that were born unto him in
Jerusalem Shammuah and Shobab and Nathan and Solomon 515 Ibhar
also and Elishua and Nepheg and Japhia 516 And Elishama and
Eliada and Eliphalet

517 But when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king
over Israel all the Philistines came up to seek David and David
heard of it and went down to the hold

518 The Philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley of
Rephaim

519 And David enquired of the LORD saying Shall I go up to the
Philistines wilt thou deliver them into mine hand And the LORD said
unto David Go up for I will doubtless deliver the Philistines into
thine hand

520 And David came to Baalperazim and David smote them there and
said The LORD hath broken forth upon mine enemies before me as the
breach of waters Therefore he called the name of that place
Baalperazim

521 And there they left their images and David and his men burned
them

522 And the Philistines came up yet again and spread themselves in
the valley of Rephaim

523 And when David enquired of the LORD he said Thou shalt not go
up but fetch a compass behind them and come upon them over against
the mulberry trees

524 And let it be when thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops
of the mulberry trees that then thou shalt bestir thyself for then
shall the LORD go out before thee to smite the host of the
Philistines

525 And David did so as the LORD had commanded him and smote the
Philistines from Geba until thou come to Gazer

61 Again David gathered together all the chosen men of Israel
thirty thousand

62 And David arose and went with all the people that were with him
from Baale of Judah to bring up from thence the ark of God whose
name is called by the name of the LORD of hosts that dwelleth between
the cherubims

63 And they set the ark of God upon a new cart and brought it out of
the house of Abinadab that was in Gibeah and Uzzah and Ahio the sons
of Abinadab drave the new cart

64 And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab which was at
Gibeah accompanying the ark of God and Ahio went before the ark

65 And David and all the house of Israel played before the LORD on
all manner of instruments made of fir wood even on harps and on
psalteries and on timbrels and on cornets and on cymbals

66 And when they came to Nachons threshingfloor Uzzah put forth his
hand to the ark of God and took hold of it for the oxen shook it

67 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzzah and God smote
him there for his error and there he died by the ark of God

68 And David was displeased because the LORD had made a breach upon
Uzzah and he called the name of the place Perezuzzah to this day

69 And David was afraid of the LORD that day and said How shall the
ark of the LORD come to me  610 So David would not remove the ark of
the LORD unto him into the city of David but David carried it aside
into the house of Obededom the Gittite

611 And the ark of the LORD continued in the house of Obededom the
Gittite three months and the LORD blessed Obededom and all his
household

612 And it was told king David saying The LORD hath blessed the
