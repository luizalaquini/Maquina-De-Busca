1532 Then Jesus called his disciples unto him and said I have
compassion on the multitude because they continue with me now three
days and have nothing to eat and I will not send them away fasting
lest they faint in the way

1533 And his disciples say unto him Whence should we have so much
bread in the wilderness as to fill so great a multitude  1534 And
Jesus saith unto them How many loaves have ye And they said Seven
and a few little fishes

1535 And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground

1536 And he took the seven loaves and the fishes and gave thanks
and brake them and gave to his disciples and the disciples to the
multitude

1537 And they did all eat and were filled and they took up of the
broken meat that was left seven baskets full

1538 And they that did eat were four thousand men beside women and
children

1539 And he sent away the multitude and took ship and came into the
coasts of Magdala

161 The Pharisees also with the Sadducees came and tempting desired
him that he would shew them a sign from heaven

162 He answered and said unto them When it is evening ye say It
will be fair weather for the sky is red

163 And in the morning It will be foul weather to day for the sky
is red and lowering O ye hypocrites ye can discern the face of the
sky but can ye not discern the signs of the times  164 A wicked and
adulterous generation seeketh after a sign and there shall no sign be
given unto it but the sign of the prophet Jonas And he left them
and departed

165 And when his disciples were come to the other side they had
forgotten to take bread

166 Then Jesus said unto them Take heed and beware of the leaven of
the Pharisees and of the Sadducees

167 And they reasoned among themselves saying It is because we have
taken no bread

168 Which when Jesus perceived he said unto them O ye of little
faith why reason ye among yourselves because ye have brought no
bread  169 Do ye not yet understand neither remember the five
loaves of the five thousand and how many baskets ye took up  1610
Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand and how many baskets ye
took up  1611 How is it that ye do not understand that I spake it
not to you concerning bread that ye should beware of the leaven of
the Pharisees and of the Sadducees  1612 Then understood they how
that he bade them not beware of the leaven of bread but of the
doctrine of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees

1613 When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi he asked
his disciples saying Whom do men say that I the Son of man am
1614 And they said Some say that thou art John the Baptist some
Elias and others Jeremias or one of the prophets

1615 He saith unto them But whom say ye that I am  1616 And Simon
Peter answered and said Thou art the Christ the Son of the living
God

1617 And Jesus answered and said unto him Blessed art thou Simon
Barjona for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my
Father which is in heaven

1618 And I say also unto thee That thou art Peter and upon this
rock I will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail
against it

1619 And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and
whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and
whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven

1620 Then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that
he was Jesus the Christ

1621 From that time forth began Jesus to shew unto his disciples how
that he must go unto Jerusalem and suffer many things of the elders
and chief priests and scribes and be killed and be raised again the
third day

1622 Then Peter took him and began to rebuke him saying Be it far
from thee Lord this shall not be unto thee

1623 But he turned and said unto Peter Get thee behind me Satan
thou art an offence unto me for thou savourest not the things that be
of God but those that be of men

1624 Then said Jesus unto his disciples If any man will come after
me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me

1625 For whosoever will save his life shall lose it and whosoever
will lose his life for my sake shall find it
