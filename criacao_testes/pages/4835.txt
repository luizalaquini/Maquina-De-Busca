slew him also

3811 Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law Remain a widow at
thy fathers house till Shelah my son be grown for he said Lest
peradventure he die also as his brethren did And Tamar went and
dwelt in her fathers house

3812 And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judahs wife died
and Judah was comforted and went up unto his sheepshearers to
Timnath he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite

3813 And it was told Tamar saying Behold thy father in law goeth up
to Timnath to shear his sheep

3814 And she put her widows garments off from her and covered her
with a vail and wrapped herself and sat in an open place which is
by the way to Timnath for she saw that Shelah was grown and she was
not given unto him to wife

3815 When Judah saw her he thought her to be an harlot because she
had covered her face

3816 And he turned unto her by the way and said Go to I pray thee
let me come in unto thee for he knew not that she was his daughter
in law And she said What wilt thou give me that thou mayest come
in unto me  3817 And he said I will send thee a kid from the flock
And she said Wilt thou give me a pledge till thou send it  3818
And he said What pledge shall I give thee And she said Thy signet
and thy bracelets and thy staff that is in thine hand And he gave it
her and came in unto her and she conceived by him

3819 And she arose and went away and laid by her vail from her and
put on the garments of her widowhood

3820 And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite
to receive his pledge from the womans hand but he found her not

3821 Then he asked the men of that place saying Where is the
harlot that was openly by the way side And they said There was no
harlot in this place

3822 And he returned to Judah and said I cannot find her and also
the men of the place said that there was no harlot in this place

3823 And Judah said Let her take it to her lest we be shamed
behold I sent this kid and thou hast not found her

3824 And it came to pass about three months after that it was told
Judah saying Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot and
also behold she is with child by whoredom And Judah said Bring her
forth and let her be burnt

3825 When she was brought forth she sent to her father in law
saying By the man whose these are am I with child and she said
Discern I pray thee whose are these the signet and bracelets and
staff

3826 And Judah acknowledged them and said She hath been more
righteous than I because that I gave her not to Shelah my son And he
knew her again no more

3827 And it came to pass in the time of her travail that behold
twins were in her womb

3828 And it came to pass when she travailed that the one put out
his hand and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet
thread saying This came out first

3829 And it came to pass as he drew back his hand that behold his
brother came out and she said How hast thou broken forth this
breach be upon thee therefore his name was called Pharez

3830 And afterward came out his brother that had the scarlet thread
upon his hand and his name was called Zarah

391 And Joseph was brought down to Egypt and Potiphar an officer of
Pharaoh captain of the guard an Egyptian bought him of the hands of
the Ishmeelites which had brought him down thither

392 And the LORD was with Joseph and he was a prosperous man and he
was in the house of his master the Egyptian

393 And his master saw that the LORD was with him and that the LORD
made all that he did to prosper in his hand

394 And Joseph found grace in his sight and he served him and he
made him overseer over his house and all that he had he put into his
hand

395 And it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer
in his house and over all that he had that the LORD blessed the
Egyptians house for Josephs sake and the blessing of the LORD was
upon all that he had in the house and in the field

396 And he left all that he had in Josephs hand and he knew not
ought he had save the bread which he did eat And Joseph was a goodly
person and well favoured

397 And it came to pass after these things that his masters wife
cast her eyes upon Joseph and she said Lie with me
