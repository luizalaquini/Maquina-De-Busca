Cheese sandwiches are passed around and we eat
them in the shade of the trees I intentionally sit at the far
edge of the group next to Pollux so I dont have to talk No
ones talking much really In the relative quiet the birds
take back the woods I nudge Pollux with my elbow and
point out a small black bird with a crown It hops to a new
branch momentarily opening its wings showing off its
white patches Pollux gestures to my pin and raises his
eyebrows questioningly I nod confirming its a mockingjay
I hold up one finger to say Wait Ill show you and whistle a
birdcall The mockingjay cocks its head and whistles the
call right back at me Then to my surprise Pollux whistles a
few notes of his own The bird answers him immediately
Polluxs face breaks into an expression of delight and he
has a series of melodic exchanges with the mockingjay My
guess is its the first conversation hes had in years Music
draws mockingjays like blossoms do bees and in a short
while hes got half a dozen of them perched in the branches
over our heads He taps me on the arm and uses a twig to
write a word in the dirt SING
Usually Id decline but its kind of impossible to say no
to Pollux given the circumstances Besides the
mockingjays song voices are different from their whistles
and Id like him to hear them So before I actually think
about what Im doing I sing Rues four notes the ones she
used to signal the end of the workday in 11 The notes that
ended up as the background music to her murder The
birds dont know that They pick up the simple phrase and
bounce it back and forth between them in sweet harmony
Just as they did in the Hunger Games before the muttations
broke through the trees chased us onto the Cornucopia
and slowly gnawed Cato to a bloody pulp--
Want to hear them do a real song I burst out
Anything to stop those memories Im on my feet moving
back into the trees resting my hand on the rough trunk of a
maple where the birds perch I have not sung The Hanging
Tree out loud for ten years because its forbidden but I
remember every word I begin softly sweetly as my father
did
Are you are you
Coming to the tree
Where they strung up a man they say
murdered three
Strange things did happen here
No stranger would it be
If we met up at midnight in the hanging tree
The mockingjays begin to alter their songs as they
become aware of my new offering
Are you are you
Coming to the tree
Where the dead man called out for his love
to flee
Strange things did happen here
No stranger would it be
If we met up at midnight in the hanging tree
I have the birds attention now In one more verse
surely they will have captured the melody as its simple and
repeats four times with little variation
Are you are you
Coming to the tree
Where I told you to run so wed both be free
Strange things did happen here
No stranger would it be
If we met up at midnight in the hanging tree
A hush in the trees Just the rustle of leaves in the
breeze But no birds mockingjay or other Peetas right
They do fall silent when I sing Just as they did for my father
Are you are you
Coming to the tree
Wear a necklace of rope side by side with
me
Strange things did happen here
No stranger would it be
If we met up at midnight in the hanging tree
The birds are waiting for me to continue But thats it
Last verse In the stillness I remember the scene I was
home from a day in the woods with my father Sitting on the
floor with Prim who was just a toddler singing The
Hanging Tree Making us necklaces out of scraps of old
rope like it said in the song not knowing the real meaning
of the words The tune was simple and easy to harmonize
to though and back then I could memorize almost anything
set to music after a round or two Suddenly my mother
snatched the rope necklaces away and was yelling at my
father I started to cry because my mother never yelled and
then Prim was wailing and I ran outside to hide As I had
exactly one hiding spot--in the Meadow under a
honeysuckle bush--my father found me immediately He
calmed me down and told me everything was fine only
wed better not sing that song anymore My mother just
wanted me to forget it So of course every word was
immediately irrevocably branded into my brain
We didnt sing it anymore my father and I or even
speak of it After he died it used to come back to me a lot
Being older I began to understand the lyrics At the
beginning it sounds like a guy is trying to get his girlfriend
to secretly meet up with him at midnight But its an odd
place for a tryst a hanging tree where a man was hung for
murder The murderers lover must have had something to
do with the killing or maybe they were just going to punish
