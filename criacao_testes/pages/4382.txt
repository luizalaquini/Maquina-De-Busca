The stress assignment rules can work on phonemic script as well as English
For example starting from the phonetic
form  dVu c
ul
aa s t o n i sh c
dVu
the stress assignment rules
produce  c
ul
aa s t ou1d n i sh c
  the
vowel reduction rule
generates  c
ul
uh s t ou1d n i sh c
  and
the foot conversion process
gives  c
ul
uh st o n i sh
This appears to provide a fairly reliable algorithm for foot boundary
placement
rh Speech synthesis from concept
I argued earlier that in order to derive prosodic features
of an utterance from text it
is necessary to understand its role in the dialogue its semantics
its syntax and em as we have just seen em its morphological structure
This is a very tall order and the problem of natural language comprehension
by machine is a vast research area in its own right
However in many applications requiring speech output
utterances are generated by the computer from internally stored data
rather than being read aloud from pre-prepared text
Then the problem of comprehending text may be evaded for
presumably the language-generation module can provide a semantic
syntactic and even morphological decomposition of the utterance
as well as some indication of its role in the dialogue
that is why it is necessary to say it
pp
This forms the basis of the appealing notion of speech synthesis from concept
It has some advantages over speech generation from text and in principle
should provide more natural-sounding speech
Every word produced by the system can have a complete lexical entry which
shows its morphological decomposition and potential stress points
The full syntactic history of each utterance is known
The Chomsky-Halle rules described above can therefore be used to place
foot boundaries accurately without the need for a complex parsing program
and without the risk of having to make guesses about unknown words
pp
However it is not clear how to take advantage of any semantic information
which is available  Ideally it should be possible to place tone group
boundaries and tonic stress points and assign intonation contours in
a natural-sounding way
But look again at the example text of Table 92 and imagine that you have
at your disposal as much semantic information as is needed
It is
ul
still
far from obvious how the intonation features could be assigned
It is in the ultimate analysis interpretive and stylistic
ul
choices
that add variety and interest to speech
pp
Take the problem of determining pitch contours for instance
Some of them may be explicable
Contour 4 on
LB
NI
except the parts that are covered in caravans of course
LE
is due to its being a contrastive clause for it presents
essentially new information
Similarly the succession
LB
NI
if you go in spring
NI
when the gorse is out
NI
or in summer
NI
when the heathers out
LE
could be considered contrastive being in the subjunctive voice and
this could explain why contour 4s were used
But this is all conjecture and it is difficult to apply throughout the
passage
Halliday 1970 explains the contexts in which each tone group is typically
used but in an extremely high-level manner which would be impossible
to embody directly in a computer program

Halliday 1970 Course in spoken English Intonation

At the other end of the spectrum computer systems for written
discourse production do not seem to provide the subtle information needed
to make intonation decisions see for example Davey 1978 for a fairly
complete description of such a system
