down and the roar of the pool thus formed spread into
the night as the head and chief among other noises of

the kind created by the deluging rain The flowers so
carefully planted by Fannys repentant lover began to
move and writhe in their bed The winter-violets
turned slowly upside down and became a mere mat of
mud Soon the snowdrop and other bulbs danced in
the boiling mass like ingredients in a cauldron Plants
of the tufted species were loosened rose to the surface

Troy did not awake from his comfortless sleep till it
was broad day Not having been in bed for two nights
his shouldrrs felt stiff his feet tender and his head
heavy He remembered his position arose shivered
took the spade and again went out
The rain had quite ceased and the sun was shining
through the green brown and yellow leaves now
sparkling and varnished by the raindrops to the bright+
ness of similar effects in the landscapes of Ruysdael and
Hobbema and full of all those infinite beauties that
arise from the union of water and colour with high
lights The air was rendered so transparent by the
heavy fall of rain that the autumn hues of the middle
distance were as rich as those near at hand and the
remote fields intercepted by the angle of the tower ap+
peared in the same plane as the tower itself
He entered the gravel path which would take him
behind the tower The path instead of being stony as
it had been the night before was browned over with a
thin coating of mud At one place in the path he saw
a tuft of stringy roots washed white and clean as a
bundle of tendons He picked it up -- surely it could
not be one of the primroses he had planted He saw
a bulb another and another as he advanced Beyond
doubt they were the crocuses With a face of perplexed
dismay Troy turned the corner and then beheld the
wreck the stream had made
The pool upon the grave had soaked away into the
ground and in its place was a hollow The disturbed
earth was washed over the grass and pathway in the
guise of the brown mud he had already seen and it
spotted the marble tombstone with the same stains
Nearly all the flowers were washed clean out of the
ground and they lay roots upwards on the spots whither
they had been splashed by the stream

Troys brow became heavily contracted He set his
teeth closely and his compressed lips moved as those of
one in great pain This singular accident by a strange
confluence of emotions in him was felt as the sharpest
sting of all Troys face was very expressive and any
observer who had seen him now would hardly have
believed him to be a man who had laughed and sung
and poured love-trifles into a womans ear To curse
his miserable lot was at first his impulse but even that
lowest stage of rebellion needed an activity whose
absence was necessarily antecedent to the existence of the
morbid misery which wrung him The sight coming
as it did superimposed upon the other dark scenery of
the previous days formed a sort of climax to the whole
panorama and it was more than he could endure
Sanguine by nature Troy had a power of eluding
grief by simply adjourning it He could put off the
consideration of any particular spectre till the matter
had become old and softened by time The planting
of flowers on Fannys grave had been perhaps but a
species of elusion of the primary grief and now it was
as if his intention had been known and circumvented
Almost for the first time in his life Troy as he stood
by this dismantled grave wished himself another man
lt is seldom that a person with much animal spirit does
not feel that the fact of his life being his own is the one
qualification which singles it out as a more hopeful life
than that of others who may actually resemble him in
every particular Troy had felt in his transient way
hundreds of times that he could not envy other people
their condition because the possession of that condition
would have necessitated a different personality when he
desired no other than his own He had not minded
the peculiarities of his birth the vicissitudes of his life
the meteoriike uncertainty of all that related to him
because these appertained to the hero of his story
without whom there would have been no story at all for
him and it seemed to be only in the nature of things
that matters would right themselves at some proper date
and wind up well This very morning the illusion
completed its disappearance and as it were all of a
sudden Troy hated himself The suddenness was

apparent than real A coral reef which
just comes short of the ocean surface is no more to the
horizon than if it had never been begun and the mere
finishing stroke is what often appears to create an event
which has long been potentially an accomplished thing
He stood and mediated -- a miserable man Whither
should he go   He that is accursed let him be accursed
