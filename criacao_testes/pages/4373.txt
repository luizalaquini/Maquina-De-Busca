FG Table 83  The quantities that define a pitch contour
pp
The intention of this parametric method of specifying contours
is that the parameters should be easily derivable from semantic variables
like emphasis novelty of idea surprise uncertainty incompleteness
Here we really are getting into controversial unresearched areas
Roughly speaking parameters D and G control emphasis G by itself
controls novelty and surprise and H and the relative sizes of E and F
control uncertainty and incompleteness
Certain parameters notably I and J are defined because although they
do not appear to correspond to semantic distinctions we do not yet know
how to generate them automatically

FG Table 84  Pitch contour table for Hallidays primary tone groups
pp
One basic requirement of the pitch assignment scheme was the ability to
generate contours which approximate Hallidays five primary tone groups
Values of the ten specifiable quantities are given in Table 84 for each
tone group
All pitches are given in Hz
A distinctly dipping pitch movement has been given to each pretonic foot
parameter D
to lend prominence to the salient syllables
sh 84  Evaluating prosodic synthesis
pp
It is extraordinarily difficult to evaluate schemes for prosodic synthesis
and this is surely a large part of the reason why prosodics are among the
least advanced aspects of artificial speech
Segmental synthesis can be tested by playing people minimal pairs of
words which differ in just one feature that is being investigated
For example one might experiment with pit bit tot dot
cot got to test the rules which discriminate unvoiced from voiced stops
There are standard word-lists for intelligibility tests which can be
used to compare systems too
No equivalent of such micro-level evaluation exists for prosodics
for they by definition have a holistic effect on utterances
They are most noticeable and most important in longish stretches of speech
Even monotonous arhythmic speech will be intelligible in
sufficiently short samples provided the segmentals are good enough
but it is quite impossible to concentrate on such speech in quantity
Some attempts at evaluation appear in Ainsworth 1974 and McHugh 1976
but these are primarily directed at assessing the success of pronunciation
rules which are discussed in the next chapter

Ainsworth 1974 Performance of a speech synthesis system


McHugh 1976 Listener preference and comprehension tests

pp
One evaluation technique is to compare synthetic with natural versions
of utterances as was done in the pitch transfer experiment
The method described earlier used a sensitive paired-comparison test
where subjects heard both versions in quick succession and were asked
to judge which was most natural and intelligible
This is quite a stringent test and one that may not be so useful
for inferior completely synthetic contours
It is essential to degrade the natural utterance so that it is
comparable segmentally to the synthetic one  this was done in the
experiment described by extracting its pitch and resynthesizing it
from linear predictive coefficients
pp
Several other experiments could be undertaken to evaluate artificial
prosody
For example one could compare
