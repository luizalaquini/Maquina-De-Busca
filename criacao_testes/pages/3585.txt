Aye and which king is that old Reysen yelled back down before Woth cuffed him into silence

Yoren climbed the battlement beside the gate his faded black cloak tied to a wooden staff You men hold down here he shouted The townfolk’s gone

And who are you old man One of Lord Beric’s cravens called the knight in the spiked helm If that fat fool Thoros is in there ask him how he likes these fires

Got no such man here Yoren shouted back Only some lads for the Watch Got no part o’ your war He hoisted up the staff so they could all see the color of his cloak Have a look That’s black for the Night’s Watch

Or black for House Dondarrion called the man who bore the enemy banner Arya could see its colors more clearly now in the light of the burning town a golden lion on red Lord Beric’s sigil is a purple lightning bolt on a black field

Suddenly Arya remembered the morning she had thrown the orange in Sansa’s face and gotten juice all over her stupid ivory silk gown There had been some southron lordling at the tourney her sister’s stupid friend Jeyne was in love with him He had a lightning bolt on his shield and her father had sent him out to behead the Hound’s brother It seemed a thousand years ago now something that had happened to a different person in a different life… to Arya Stark the Hand’s daughter not Arry the orphan boy How would Arry know lords and such

Are you blind man Yoren waved his staff back and forth making the cloak ripple You see a bloody lightning bolt

By night all banners look black the knight in the spiked helm observed Open or we’ll know you for outlaws in league with the king’s enemies

Yoren spat Who’s got your command

I do The reflections of burning houses glimmered dully on the armor of his warhorse as the others parted to let him pass He was a stout man with a manticore on his shield and ornate scrollwork crawling across his steel breastplate Through the open visor of his helm a face pale and piggy peered up Ser Amory Lorch bannerman to Lord Tywin Lannister of Casterly Rock the Hand of the King The true king Joffrey He had a high thin voice In his name I command you to open these gates

All around them the town burned The night air was full of smoke and the drifting red embers outnumbered the stars Yoren scowled Don’t see the need Do what you want to the town it’s naught to me but leave us be We’re no foes to you

Look with your eyes Arya wanted to shout at the men below Can’t they see we’re no lords or knights she whispered

I don’t think they care Arry Gendry whispered back

And she looked at Ser Amory’s face the way Syrio had taught her to look and she saw that he was right

If you are no traitors open your gates Ser Amory called We’ll make certain you’re telling it true and be on our way

Yoren was chewing sourleaf Told you no one here but us You got my word on that

The knight in the spiked helm laughed The crow gives us his word

You lost old man mocked one of the spearmen The Wall’s a long way north o’ here

I command you once more in King Joffrey’s name to prove the loyalty you profess and open these gates said Ser Amory

For a long moment Yoren considered chewing Then he spat Don’t think I will

So be it You defy the king’s command and so proclaim yourselves rebels black cloaks or no

Got me young boys in here Yoren shouted down

Young boys and old men die the same Ser Amory raised a lanquid fist and a spear came hurtling from the fire-bright shadows behind Yoren must have been the target but it was Woth beside him who was hit The spearhead went in his throat and exploded out the back of his neck dark and wet Woth grabbed at the shaft and fell boneless from the walk

Storm the walls and kill them all Ser Amory said in a bored voice More spears flew Arya yanked down Hot Pie by the back of his tunic From outside came the rattle of armor the scrape of swords on scabbards the banging of spears on shields mingled with curses and the hoofbeats of racing horses A torch sailed spinning above their heads trailing fingers of fire as it thumped down in the dirt of the yard

Blades Yoren shouted Spread apart defend the wall wherever they hit Koss Urreg hold the postern Lommy pull that spear out of Woth and get up where he was

Hot Pie dropped his shortsword when he tried to unsheath it Arya shoved the blade back into his hand I don’t know how to swordfight he said white-eyed

It’s easy Arya said but the lie died in her throat as a hand grasped the top of the parapet She saw it by the light of the burning town so clear that it was as if time had stopped The fingers were blunt callused wiry black hairs grew between the knuckles there was dirt under the nail of the thumb Fear cuts deeper than swords she remembered as the top of a pothelm loomed up behind the hand

She slashed down hard and Needle’s castle-forged steel bit into the grasping fingers between the knuckles Winterfell she screamed Blood spurted fingers flew and the helmed face vanished as suddenly as it had appeared Behind Hot Pie yelled Arya whirled The second man was bearded and helmetless his dirk between his teeth to leave both hands free for climbing As he swung his leg over the parapet she drove her point at his eyes Needle never touched him he reeled backward and fell I hope he falls on his face and cuts off his tongue Watch them not me she screamed at Hot Pie The next time someone tried to climb their part of the wall the boy hacked at his hands with his swordshort until the man dropped away

Ser Amory had no ladders but the holdfast walls were rough-cut and unmortared easy to climb and there seemed to be no end to the foes For each one Arya cut or stabbed or shoved back another was coming over the wall The knight in the spiked helm reached the rampart but Yoren tangled his black banner around his spike and forced the point of his dirk through his armor while the man was fighting the cloth Every time Arya looked up more torches were flying trailing long tongues of flame that lingered behind her eyes She saw a gold lion on a red banner and thought of Joffrey wishing he was here so she could drive Needle through his sneery face When four men assaulted the gate with axes Koss shot them down with arrows one by one Dobber wrestled a man off the walk and Lommy smashed his head with a rock before he could rise and hooted until he saw the knife in Dobber’s belly and realized he wouldn’t be getting up either Arya jumped over a dead boy no older than Jon lying with his arm cut off She didn’t think she’d done it but she wasn’t sure She heard Qyle beg for mercy before a knight with a wasp on his shield smashed his face in with a spiked mace Everything smelled of blood and smoke and iron and piss but after a time it seemed like that was only one smell She never saw how the skinny man got over the wall but when he did she fell on him with Gendry and Hot Pie Gendry’s sword shattered on the man’s helm tearing it off his head Underneath he was bald and scared-looking with missing teeth and a speckly grey beard but even as she was feeling sorry for him she was killing him shouting Winterfell Winterfell while Hot Pie screamed Hot Pie beside her as he hacked at the man’s scrawny neck

When the skinny man was dead Gendry stole his sword and leapt down into the yard to fight some more Arya looked past him and saw steel shadows running through the holdfast firelight shining off mail and blades and she knew that they’d gotten over the wall somewhere or broken through at the postern She jumped down beside Gendry landing the way Syrio had taught her The night rang to the clash of steel and the cries of the wounded and dying For a moment Arya stood uncertain not knowing which way to go Death was all around her

And then Yoren was there shaking her screaming in her face Boy he yelled the way he always yelled it Get out it’s done we’ve lost Herd up all you can you and him and the others the boys you get them out Now

How Arya said

That trap he screamed Under the barn

Quick as that he was gone off to fight sword in hand Arya grabbed Gendry by the arm He said go she shouted the barn the way out Through the slits of his helm the Bull’s eyes shone with reflected fire He nodded They called Hot Pie down from the wall and found Lommy Greenhands where he lay bleeding from a spear thrust through his calf They found Gerren too but he was hurt too bad to move As they were running toward the barn Arya spied the crying girl sitting in the middle of the chaos surrounded by smoke and slaughter She grabbed her by the hand and pulled her to her feet as the others raced ahead The girl wouldn’t walk even when slapped Arya dragged her with her right hand while she held Needle in the left Ahead the night was a sullen red The barn’s on fire she thought Flames were licking up its sides from where a torch had fallen on straw and she could hear the screaming of the animals trapped within Hot Pie stepped out of the barn Arry come on Lommy’s gone leave her if she won’t come

Stubbornly Arya dragged all the harder pulling the crying girl along Hot Pie scuttled back inside abandoning them… but Gendry came back the fire shining so bright on his polished helm that the horns seemed to glow orange He ran to them and hoisted the crying girl up over his shoulder Run

Rushing through the barn doors was like running into a furnace The air was swirling with smoke the back wall a sheet of fire ground to roof Their horses and donkeys were kicking and rearing and screaming The poor animals Arya thought Then she saw the wagon and the three men manacled to its bed Biter was flinging himself against the chains blood running down his arms from where the irons clasped his wrists Rorge screamed curses kicking at the wood Boy called Jaqen H’ghar Sweet boy

The open trap was only a few feet ahead but the fire was spreading fast consuming the old wood and dry straw faster than she would have believed Arya remembered the Hound’s horrible burned face Tunnel’s narrow Gendry shouted How do we get her through

Pull her Arya said Push her

Good boys kind boys called Jaqen H’ghar coughing

Get these fucking chains off Rorge screamed

Gendry ignored them You go first then her then me Hurry it’s a long way

When you split the firewood Arya remembered where did you leave the axe

Out by the haven He spared a glance for the chained men I’d save the donkeys first There’s no time

You take her she yelled You get her out You do it The fire beat at her back with hot red wings as she fled the burning barn It felt blessedly cool outside but men were dying all around her She saw Koss throw down his blade to yield and she saw them kill him where he stood Smoke was everywhere There was no sign of Yoren but the axe was where Gendry had left it by the woodpile outside the haven As she wrenched it free a mailed hand grabbed her arm Spinning Arya drove the head of the axe hard between his legs She never saw his face only the dark blood seeping between the links of his hauberk Going back into that barn was the hardest thing she ever did Smoke was pouring out the open door like a writhing black snake and she could hear the screams of the poor animals inside donkeys and horses and men She chewed her lip and darted through the doors crouched low where the smoke wasn’t quite so thick

A donkey was caught in a ring of fire shrieking in terror and pain She could smell the stench of burning hair The roof was gone up too and things were falling down pieces of flaming wood and bits of straw and hay Arya put a hand over her mouth and nose She couldn’t see the wagon for the smoke but she could still hear Biter screaming She crawled toward the sound

And then a wheel was looming over her The wagon jumped and moved a half foot when Biter threw himself against his chains again Jaqen saw her but it was too hard to breathe let alone talk She threw the axe into the wagon Rorge caught it and lifted it over his head rivers of sooty sweat pouring down his noseless face Arya was running coughing She heard the steel crash through the old wood and again again An instant later came a crack as loud as thunder and the bottom of the wagon came ripping loose in an explosion of splinters

Arya rolled headfirst into the tunnel and dropped five feet She got dirt in her mouth but she didn’t care the taste was fine the taste was mud and water and worms and life Under the earth the air was cool and dark Above was nothing but blood and roaring red and choking smoke and the screams of dying horses She moved her belt around so Needle would not be in her way and began to crawl A dozen feet down the tunnel she heard the sound like the roar of some monstrous beast and a cloud of hot smoke and black dust came billowing up behind her smelling of hell Arya held her breath and kissed the mud on the floor of the tunnel and cried For whom she could not say





TYRION
