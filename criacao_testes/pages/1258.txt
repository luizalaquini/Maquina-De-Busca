Why no I trust you implicitly A bitter laugh echoed off the shuttered windows I trust you like one of my own blood in truth Now tell me how Cortnay Penrose died

It is said that he threw himself from a tower

Threw himself No I will not believe that

His guards saw no man enter his chambers nor did they find any within afterward

Then the killer entered earlier and hid under the bed Tyrion suggested or he climbed down from the roof on a rope Perhaps the guards are lying Who’s to say they did not do the thing themselves

Doubtless you are right my lord

His smug tone said otherwise But you do not think so How was it done then

For a long moment Varys said nothing The only sound was the stately clack of horseshoes on cobbles Finally the eunuch cleared his throat My lord do you believe in the old powers

Magic you mean Tyrion said impatiently Bloodspells curses shapeshifting those sorts of things He snorted Do you mean to suggest that Ser Cortnay was magicked to his death

Ser Cortnay had challenged Lord Stannis to single combat on the morning he died I ask you is this the act of a man lost to despair Then there is the matter of Lord Renly’s mysterious and most fortuitous murder even as his battle lines were forming up to sweep his brother from the field The eunuch paused a moment My lord you once asked me how it was that I was cut

I recall said Tyrion You did not want to talk of it

Nor do I but… This pause was longer than the one before and when Varys spoke again his voice was different somehow I was an orphan boy apprenticed to a traveling folly Our master owned a fat little cog and we sailed up and down the narrow sea performing in all the Free Cities and from time to time in Oldtown and King’s Landing

One day at Myr a certain man came to our folly After the performance he made an offer for me that my master found too tempting to refuse I was in terror I feared the man meant to use me as I had heard men used small boys but in truth the only part of me he had need of was my manhood He gave me a potion that made me powerless to move or speak yet did nothing to dull my senses With a long hooked blade he sliced me root and stem chanting all the while I watched him burn my manly parts on a brazier The flames turned blue and I heard a voice answer his call though I did not understand the words they spoke

The mummers had sailed by the time he was done with me Once I had served his purpose the man had no further interest in me so he put me out When I asked him what I should do now he answered that he supposed I should die To spite him I resolved to live I begged I stole and I sold what parts of my body still remained to me Soon I was as good a thief as any in Myr and when I was older I learned that often the contents of a man’s letters are more valuable than the contents of his purse

Yet I still dream of that night my lord Not of the sorcerer nor his blade nor even the way my manhood shriveled as it burned I dream of the voice The voice from the flames Was it a god a demon some conjurer’s trick I could not tell you and I know all the tricks All I can say for a certainty is that he called it and it answered and since that day I have hated magic and all those who practice it If Lord Stannis is one such I mean to see him dead

When he was done they rode in silence for a time Finally Tyrion said A harrowing tale I’m sorry

The eunuch sighed You are sorry but you do not believe me No my lord no need to apologize I was drugged and in pain and it was a very long time ago and far across the sea No doubt I dreamed that voice I’ve told myself as much a thousand times

I believe in steel swords gold coins and men’s wits said Tyrion And I believe there once were dragons I’ve seen their skulls after all

Let us hope that is the worst thing you ever see my lord

On that we agree Tyrion smiled And for Ser Cortnay’s death well we know Stannis hired sellsails from the Free Cities Perhaps he bought himself a skilled assassin as well

A very skilled assassin

There are such I used to dream that one day I’d be rich enough to send a Faceless Man after my sweet sister

Regardless of how Ser Cortnay died said Varys he is dead the castle fallen Stannis is free to march

Any chance we might convince the Dornishmen to descend on the Marches asked Tyrion

None

A pity Well the threat may serve to keep the Marcher lords close to their castles at least What news of my father

If Lord Tywin has won across the Red Fork no word has reached me yet If he does not hasten he may be trapped between his foes The Oakheart leaf and the Rowan tree have been seen north of the Mander

No word from Littlefinger

Perhaps he never reached Bitterbridge Or perhaps he’s died there Lord Tarly has seized Renly’s stores and put a great many to the sword Florents chiefly Lord Caswell has shut himself up in his castle

Tyrion threw back his head and laughed

Varys reined up nonplussed My lord

Don’t you see the jest Lord Varys Tyrion waved a hand at the shuttered windows at all the sleeping city Storm’s End is fallen and Stannis is coming with fire and steel and the gods alone know what dark powers and the good folk don’t have Jaime to protect them nor Robert nor Renly nor Rhaegar nor their precious Knight of Flowers Only me the one they hate He laughed again The dwarf the evil counselor the twisted little monkey demon I’m all that stands between them and chaos





CATELYN

Tell Father I have gone to make him proud Her brother swung up into his saddle every inch the lord in his bright mail and flowing mud-and-water cloak A silver trout ornamented the crest of his greathelm twin to the one painted on his shield

He was always proud of you Edmure And he loves you fiercely Believe that

I mean to give him better reason than mere birth He wheeled his warhorse about and raised a hand Trumpets sounded a drum began to boom the drawbridge descended in fits and starts and Ser Edmure Tully led his men out from Riverrun with lances raised and banners streaming

I have a greater host than yours brother Catelyn thought as she watched them go A host of doubts and fears

Beside her Brienne’s misery was almost palpable Catelyn had ordered garments sewn to her measure handsome gowns to suit her birth and sex yet still she preferred to dress in oddments of mail and boiled leather a swordbelt cinched around her waist She would have been happier riding to war with Edmure no doubt but even walls as strong as Riverrun’s required swords to hold them Her brother had taken every able-bodied man for the fords leaving Ser Desmond Grell to command a garrison made up of the wounded the old and the sick along with a few squires and some untrained peasant boys still shy of manhood This to defend a castle crammed full of women and children

When the last of Edmure’s foot had shuffled under the portcullis Brienne asked What shall we do now my lady

Our duty Catelyn’s face was drawn as she started across the yard I have always done my duty she thought Perhaps that was why her lord father had always cherished her best of all his children Her two older brothers had both died in infancy so she had been son as well as daughter to Lord Hoster until Edmure was born Then her mother had died and her father had told her that she must be the lady of Riverrun now and she had done that too And when Lord Hoster promised her to Brandon Stark she had thanked him for making her such a splendid match

I gave Brandon my favor to wear and never comforted Petyr once after he was wounded nor bid him farewell when Father sent him off And when Brandon was murdered and Father told me I must wed his brother I did so gladly though I never saw Ned’s face until our wedding day I gave my maidenhood to this solemn stranger and sent him off to his war and his king and the woman who bore him his bastard because I always did my duty

Her steps took her to the sept a seven-sided sandstone temple set amidst her mother’s gardens and filled with rainbow light It was crowded when they entered Catelyn was not alone in her need for prayer She knelt before the painted marble image of the Warrior and lit a scented candle for Edmure and another for Robb off beyond the hills Keep them safe and help them to victory she prayed and bring peace to the souls of the slain and comfort to those they leave behind

The septon entered with his censer and crystal while she was at her prayers so Catelyn lingered for the celebration She did not know this septon an earnest young man close to Edmure’s age He performed his office well enough and his voice was rich and pleasant when he sang the praises to the Seven but Catelyn found herself yearning for the thin quavering tones of Septon Osmynd long dead Osmynd would have listened patiently to the tale of what she had seen and felt in Renly’s pavilion and he might have known what it meant as well and what she must do to lay to rest the shadows that stalked her dreams Osmynd my father Uncle Brynden old Maester Kym they always seemed to know everything but now there is only me and it seems I know nothing not even my duty How can I do my duty if I do not know where it lies

Catelyn’s knees were stiff by the time she rose though she felt no wiser Perhaps she would go to the godswood tonight and pray to Ned’s gods as well They were older than the Seven

Outside she found song of a very different sort Rymund the Rhymer sat by the brewhouse amidst a circle of listeners his deep voice ringing as he sang of Lord Deremond at the Bloody Meadow

And there he stood with sword in hand

the last of Darry’s ten…

Brienne paused to listen for a moment broad shoulders hunched and thick arms crossed against her chest A mob of ragged boys raced by screeching and flailing at each other with sticks Why do boys so love to play at war Catelyn wondered if Rymund was the answer The singer’s voice swelled as he neared the end of his song
