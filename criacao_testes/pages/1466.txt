His ravens said Jojen

Hodor said Hodor

Was he green Bran wanted to know Did he have antlers

The fat man was confused The elk

Coldhands said Bran impatiently The green men ride on elks Old Nan used to say Sometimes they have antlers too

He wasn’t a green man He wore blacks like a brother of the Watch but he was pale as a wight with hands so cold that at first I was afraid The wights have blue eyes though and they don’t have tongues or they’ve forgotten how to use them The fat man turned to Jojen He’ll be waiting We should go Do you have anything warmer to wear The Black Gate is cold and the other side of the Wall is even colder You—

Why didn’t he come with you Meera gestured toward Gilly and her babe They came with you why not him Why didn’t you bring him through this Black Gate too

He… he can’t

Why not

The Wall The Wall is more than just ice and stone he said There are spells woven into it… old ones and strong He cannot pass beyond the Wall

It grew very quiet in the castle kitchen then Bran could hear the soft crackle of the flames the wind stirring the leaves in the night the creak of the skinny weirwood reaching for the moon Beyond the gates the monsters live and the giants and the ghouls he remembered Old Nan saying but they cannot pass so long as the Wall stands strong So go to sleep my little Brandon my baby boy You needn’t fear There are no monsters here

I am not the one you were told to bring Jojen Reed told fat Sam in his stained and baggy blacks He is

Oh Sam looked down at him uncertainly It might have been just then that he realized Bran was crippled I don’t… I’m not strong enough to carry you I…

Hodor can carry me Bran pointed at his basket I ride in that up on his back

Sam was staring at him You’re Jon Snow’s brother The one who fell…

No said Jojen That boy is dead

Don’t tell Bran warned Please

Sam looked confused for a moment but finally he said I… I can keep a secret Gilly too When he looked at her the girl nodded Jon… Jon was my brother too He was the best friend I ever had but he went off with Qhorin Halfhand to scout the Frostfangs and never came back We were waiting for him on the Fist when… when…

Jon’s here Bran said Summer saw him He was with some wildlings but they killed a man and Jon took his horse and escaped I bet he went to Castle Black

Sam turned big eyes on Meera You’re certain it was Jon You saw him

I’m Meera Meera said with a smile Summer is…

A shadow detached itself from the broken dome above and leapt down through the moonlight Even with his injured leg the wolf landed as light and quiet as a snowfall The girl Gilly made a frightened sound and clutched her babe so hard against her that it began to cry again

He won’t hurt you Bran said That’s Summer

Jon said you all had wolves Sam pulled off a glove I know Ghost He held out a shaky hand the fingers white and soft and fat as little sausages Summer padded closer sniffed them and gave the hand a lick

That was when Bran made up his mind We’ll go with you

All of you Sam seemed surprised by that

Meera ruffled Bran’s hair He’s our prince

Summer circled the well sniffing He paused by the top step and looked back at Bran He wants to go

Will Gilly be safe if I leave her here till I come back Sam asked them

She should be said Meera She’s welcome to our fire

Jojen said The castle is empty

Gilly looked around Craster used to tell us tales of castles but I never knew they’d be so big

It’s only the kitchens Bran wondered what she’d think when she saw Winterfell if she ever did

It took them a few minutes to gather their things and hoist Bran into his wicker seat on Hodor’s back By the time they were ready to go Gilly sat nursing her babe by the fire You’ll come back for me she said to Sam

As soon as I can he promised then we’ll go somewhere warm When he heard that part of Bran wondered what he was doing Will I ever go someplace warm again

I’ll go first I know the way Sam hesitated at the top There’s just so many steps he sighed before he started down Jojen followed then Summer then Hodor with Bran riding on his back Meera took the rear with her spear and net in hand

It was a long way down The top of the well was bathed in moonlight but it grew smaller and dimmer every time they went around Their footsteps echoed off the damp stones and the water sounds grew louder Should we have brought torches Jojen asked

Your eyes will adjust said Sam Keep one hand on the wall and you won’t fall

The well grew darker and colder with every turn When Bran finally lifted his head around to look back up the shaft the top of the well was no bigger than a half-moon Hodor Hodor whispered Hodorhodorhodorhodorhodorhodor the well whispered back The water sounds were close but when Bran peered down he saw only blackness

A turn or two later Sam stopped suddenly He was a quarter of the way around the well from Bran and Hodor and six feet farther down yet Bran could barely see him He could see the door though The Black Gate Sam had called it but it wasn’t black at all

It was white weirwood and there was a face on it

A glow came from the wood like milk and moonlight so faint it scarcely seemed to touch anything beyond the door itself not even Sam standing right before it The face was old and pale wrinkled and shrunken It looks dead Its mouth was closed and its eyes its cheeks were sunken its brow withered its chin sagging If a man could live for a thousand years and never die but just grow older his face might come to look like that

The door opened its eyes

They were white too and blind Who are you the door asked and the well whispered Who-who-who-who-who-who-who

I am the sword in the darkness Samwell Tarly said I am the watcher on the walls I am the fire that burns against the cold the light that brings the dawn the horn that wakes the sleepers I am the shield that guards the realms of men

Then pass the door said Its lips opened wide and wider and wider still until nothing at all remained but a great gaping mouth in a ring of wrinkles Sam stepped aside and waved Jojen through ahead of him Summer followed sniffing as he went and then it was Bran’s turn Hodor ducked but not low enough The door’s upper lip brushed softly against the top of Bran’s head and a drop of water fell on him and ran slowly down his nose It was strangely warm and salty as a tear
