You are wise to suspect so my good lord

Who He cocked his head

The Kettleblacks report frequently to your sweet sister

When I think of how much coin I paid those wretched… do you think there’s any chance that more gold might win them away from Cersei

There is always a chance but I should not care to wager on the likelihood They are knights now all three and your sister has promised them further advancement A wicked little titter burst from the eunuch’s lips And the eldest Ser Osmund of the Kingsguard dreams of certain other… favors… as well You can match the queen coin for coin I have no doubt but she has a second purse that is quite inexhaustible

Seven hells thought Tyrion Are you suggesting that Cersei’s fucking Osmund Kettleblack

Oh dear me no that would be dreadfully dangerous don’t you think No the queen only hints… perhaps on the morrow or when the wedding’s done… and then a smile a whisper a ribald jest… a breast brushing lightly against his sleeve as they pass… and yet it seems to serve But what would a eunuch know of such things The tip of his tongue ran across his lower lip like a shy pink animal

If I could somehow push them beyond sly fondling arrange for Father to catch them abed together… Tyrion fingered the scab on his nose He did not see how it could be done but perhaps some plan would come to him later Are the Kettleblacks the only ones

Would that were true my lord I fear there are many eyes upon you You are… how shall we say Conspicuous And not well loved it grieves me to tell you Janos Slynt’s sons would gladly inform on you to avenge their father and our sweet Lord Petyr has friends in half the brothels of King’s Landing Should you be so unwise as to visit any of them he will know at once and your lord father soon thereafter

It’s even worse than I feared And my father Who does he have spying on me

This time the eunuch laughed aloud Why me my lord

Tyrion laughed as well He was not so great a fool as to trust Varys any further than he had to—but the eunuch already knew enough about Shae to get her well and thoroughly hanged You will bring Shae to me through the walls hidden from all these eyes As you have done before

Varys wrung his hands Oh my lord nothing would please me more but… King Maegor wanted no rats in his own walls if you take my meaning He did require a means of secret egress should he ever be trapped by his enemies but that door does not connect with any other passages I can steal your Shae away from Lady Lollys for a time to be sure but I have no way to bring her to your bedchamber without us being seen

Then bring her somewhere else

But where There is no safe place

There is Tyrion grinned Here It’s time to put that rock-hard bed of yours to better use I think

The eunuch’s mouth opened Then he giggled Lollys tires easily these days She is great with child I imagine she will be safely asleep by moonrise

Tyrion hopped down from the chair Moonrise then See that you lay in some wine And two clean cups

Varys bowed It shall be as my lord commands

The rest of the day seemed to creep by as slow as a worm in molasses Tyrion climbed to the castle library and tried to distract himself with Beldecar’s History of the Rhoynish Wars but he could hardly see the elephants for imagining Shae’s smile Come the afternoon he put the book aside and called for a bath He scrubbed himself until the water grew cool and then had Pod even out his whiskers His beard was a trial to him a tangle of yellow white and black hairs patchy and coarse it was seldom less than unsightly but it did serve to conceal some of his face and that was all to the good

When he was as clean and pink and trimmed as he was like to get Tyrion looked over his wardrobe and chose a pair of tight satin breeches in Lannister crimson and his best doublet the heavy black velvet with the lion’s head studs He would have donned his chain of golden hands as well if his father hadn’t stolen it while he lay dying It was not until he was dressed that he realized the depths of his folly Seven hells dwarf did you lose all your sense along with your nose Anyone who sees you is going to wonder why you’ve put on your court clothes to visit the eunuch Cursing Tyrion stripped and dressed again in simpler garb black woolen breeches an old white tunic and a faded brown leather jerkin It doesn’t matter he told himself as he waited for moonrise Whatever you wear you’re still a dwarf You’ll never be as tall as that knight on the steps him with his long straight legs and hard stomach and wide manly shoulders

The moon was peeping over the castle wall when he told Podrick Payne that he was going to pay a call on Varys Will you be long my lord the boy asked

Oh I hope so

With the Red Keep so crowded Tyrion could not hope to go unnoticed Ser Balon Swann stood guard on the door and Ser Loras Tyrell on the drawbridge He stopped to exchange pleasantries with both of them It was strange to see the Knight of Flowers all in white when before he had always been as colorful as a rainbow How old are you Ser Loras Tyrion asked him

Seventeen my lord

Seventeen and beautiful and already a legend Half the girls in the Seven Kingdoms want to bed him and all the boys want to be him If you will pardon my asking ser—why would anyone choose to join the Kingsguard at seventeen

Prince Aemon the Dragonknight took his vows at seventeen Ser Loras said and your brother Jaime was younger still
