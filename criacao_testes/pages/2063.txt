Hot Pie agreed They told Yoren to open the gates they told him in the king’s name You have to do what they tell you in the king’s name It was that stinky old man’s fault If he’d of yielded they would have left us be

Gendry frowned Knights and lordlings they take each other captive and pay ransoms but they don’t care if the likes of you yield or not He turned to Arya What else did you see

If it’s a fishing village they’d sell us fish I bet said Hot Pie The lake teemed with fresh fish but they had nothing to catch them with Arya had tried to use her hands the way she’d seen Koss do but fish were quicker than pigeons and the water played tricks on her eyes

I don’t know about fish Arya tugged at the Weasel’s matted hair thinking it might be best to hack it off There’s crows down by the water Something’s dead there

Fish washed up on shore Hot Pie said If the crows eat it I bet we could

We should catch some crows we could eat them said Lommy We could make a fire and roast them like chickens

Gendry looked fierce when he scowled His beard had grown in thick and black as briar I said no fires

Lommy’s hungry Hot Pie whined and I am too

We’re all hungry said Arya

You’re not Lommy spat from the ground Worm breath

Arya could have kicked him in his wound I said I’d dig worms for you too if you wanted

Lommy made a disgusted face If it wasn’t for my leg I’d hunt us some boars

Some boars she mocked You need a boarspear to hunt boars and horses and dogs and men to flush the boar from its lair Her father had hunted boar in the wolfswood with Robb and Jon Once he even took Bran but never Arya even though she was older Septa Mordane said boar hunting was not for ladies and Mother only promised that when she was older she might have her own hawk She was older now but if she had a hawk she’d eat it

What do you know about hunting boars said Hot Pie

More than you

Gendry was in no mood to hear it Quiet both of you I need to think what to do He always looked pained when he tried to think like it hurt him something fierce

Yield Lommy said

I told you to shut up about the yielding We don’t even know who’s in there Maybe we can steal some food

Lommy could steal if it wasn’t for his leg said Hot Pie He was a thief in the city

A bad thief Arya said or he wouldn’t have got caught

Gendry squinted up at the sun Evenfall will be the best time to sneak in I’ll go scout come dark

No I’ll go Arya said You’re too noisy

Gendry got that look on his face We’ll both go

Arry should go said Lommy He’s sneakier than you are

We’ll both go I said

But what if you don’t come back Hot Pie can’t carry me by himself you know he can’t   

And there’s wolves Hot Pie said I heard them last night when I had the watch They sounded close

Arya had heard them too She’d been asleep in the branches of an elm but the howling had woken her She’d sat awake for a good hour listening to them prickles creeping up her spine

And you won’t even let us have a fire to keep them off Hot Pie said It’s not right leaving us for the wolves

No one is leaving you Gendry said in disgust Lommy has his spear if the wolves come and you’ll be with him We’re just going to go see that’s all we’re coming back

Whoever it is you should yield to them Lommy whined I need some potion for my leg it hurts bad

If we see any leg potion we’ll bring it Gendry said Arry let’s go I want to get near before the sun is down Hot Pie you keep Weasel here I don’t want her following

Last time she kicked me

I’ll kick you if you don’t keep her here Without waiting for an answer Gendry donned his steel helm and walked off

Arya had to scamper to keep up Gendry was five years older and a foot taller than she was and long of leg as well For a while he said nothing just plowed on through the trees with an angry look on his face making too much noise But finally he stopped and said I think Lommy’s going to die

She was not surprised Kurz had died of his wound and he’d been a lot stronger than Lommy Whenever it was Arya’s turn to help carry him she could feel how warm his skin was and smell the stink off his leg Maybe we could find a maester   

You only find maesters in castles and even if we found one he wouldn’t dirty his hands on the likes of Lommy Gendry ducked under a low-hanging limb

That’s not true Maester Luwin would have helped anyone who came to him she was certain

He’s going to die and the sooner he does it the better for the rest of us We should just leave him like he says If it was you or me hurt you know he’d leave us They scrambled down a steep cut and up the other side using roots for handholds I’m sick of carrying him and I’m sick of all his talk about yielding too If he could stand up I’d knock his teeth in Lommy’s no use to anyone That crying girl’s no use either

You leave Weasel alone she’s just scared and hungry is all Arya glanced back but the girl was not following for once Hot Pie must have grabbed her like Gendry had told him

She’s no use Gendry repeated stubbornly Her and Hot Pie and Lommy they’re slowing us down and they’re going to get us killed You’re the only one of the bunch who’s good for anything Even if you are a girl

Arya froze in her steps I’m not a girl

Yes you are Do you think I’m as stupid as they are

No you’re stupider The Night’s Watch doesn’t take girls everyone knows that

That’s true I don’t know why Yoren brought you but he must have had some reason You’re still a girl

I am not

Then pull out your cock and take a piss Go on

I don’t need to take a piss If I wanted to I could

Liar You can’t take out your cock because you don’t have one I never noticed before when there were thirty of us but you always go off in the woods to make your water You don’t see Hot Pie doing that nor me neither If you’re not a girl you must be some eunuch

You’re the eunuch
