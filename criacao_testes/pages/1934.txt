reflection coefficients need fewer quantization bits than the a sub ks
for a given speech quality the word lengths are smaller in the
lattice realization

The advantages of the lattice method of synthesis over direct evaluation
of the prediction using filter coefficients a sub k then are
LB
NP
the reflection coefficients are used directly
NP
the stability of the filter is obvious from the reflection coefficient
values
NP
the system is more tolerant to quantization errors in fixed-point
implementations

Although it may seem unlikely that an unstable filter would be produced
by linear predictive analysis instability is in fact a real problem
in non-lattice implementations  For example
coefficients are often interpolated at the receiver to allow longer
frame times and smooth over sudden transitions and it is quite likely that
an unstable configuration is obtained when interpolating filter coefficients
between two stable configurations
This cannot happen with reflection coefficients however because a
necessary and sufficient condition for stability is that all
coefficients lie in the interval -1+1

Lattice filters are an important new method of linear predictive

analysis
as well as synthesis and so
it is worth considering the theory behind them a little further
rh Theory of the lattice synthesis filter
Figure 69 shows a single stage of the synthesis lattice given earlier
FC Figure 69
There are two signals at each side of the lattice and the z-transforms
of these have been labelled X sup + and X sup - at the left-hand side
and Y sup + and Y sup - at the right-hand side
The direction of signal flow is forwards along the upper positive path
and backwards along the lower negative one
pp
The signal flows show that the following two relationships hold
LB
EQ
Y sup + = X sup + + k z sup -1 Y sup - 
EN
for the forward upper path
br
EQ
X sup -  = -kY sup + + z sup -1 Y sup - 
EN
h-w-ufor the backward lower path
LE
Re-arranging the first equation yields
LB
EQ
X sup +  = Y sup + - k z sup -1 Y sup - 
EN
LE
and so we can describe the function of the lattice by a single matrix
equation
LB

EQ
left  matrix ccol X sup + above X sup - right  =
left  matrix ccol 1 above -k ccol -kz sup -1 above z sup -1 right 
 left  matrix ccol Y sup + above Y sup - right

It would be nice to be able to
call this an input-output equation but it is not
for the input signals to the lattice stage are X sup + and Y sup -
and the outputs are X sup - and Y sup +
We have written it in this form because it allows a multi-stage lattice to
be described by cascading these matrix equations
pp
A single-stage lattice filter has Y sup + and Y sup - connected together
forming its output call this X sub output while the input is X sup +
X sub input
Hence the input is related to the output by
LB
EQ
left  matrix ccol X sub input above sq  right   =
 left  matrix ccol 1 above -k ccol -k z sup -1
above z sup -1 right 
 left  matrix ccol X sub output above X sub output right   
EN
LE
so
LB
EQ
X sub input  =  1- k z sup -1 X sub output 
EN
LE
or
LB
EQ
X sub output over X sub input = 1 over 1- k sub 1 z sup -1
