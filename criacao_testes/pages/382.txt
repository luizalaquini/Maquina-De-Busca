He ought to have passed here last year said Thoren Smallwood A dog came sniffing round his leg He kicked it and sent it off yipping

Lord Mormont said Ben was searching for Ser Waymar Royce who’d vanished with Gared and young Will

Aye those three I recall The lordling no older than one of these pups Too proud to sleep under my roof him in his sable cloak and black steel My wives give him big cow eyes all the same He turned his squint on the nearest of the women Gared says they were chasing raiders I told him with a commander that green best not catch ’em Gared wasn’t half-bad for a crow Had less ears than me that one The ’bite took ’em same as mine Craster laughed Now I hear he got no head neither The ’bite do that too

Jon remembered a spray of red blood on white snow and the way Theon Greyjoy had kicked the dead man’s head The man was a deserter On the way back to Winterfell Jon and Robb had raced and found six direwolf pups in the snow A thousand years ago

When Ser Waymar left you where was he bound

Craster gave a shrug Happens I have better things to do than tend to the comings and goings of crows He drank a pull of beer and set the cup aside Had no good southron wine up here for a bear’s night I could use me some wine and a new axe Mine’s lost its bite can’t have that I got me women to protect He gazed around at his scurrying wives

You are few here and isolated Mormont said If you like I’ll detail some men to escort you south to the Wall

The raven seemed to like the notion Wall it screamed spreading black wings like a high collar behind Mormont’s head

Their host gave a nasty smile showing a mouthful of broken brown teeth And what would we do there serve you at supper We’re free folk here Craster serves no man

These are bad times to dwell alone in the wild The cold winds are rising

Let them rise My roots are sunk deep Craster grabbed a passing woman by the wrist Tell him wife Tell the Lord Crow how well content we are

The woman licked at thin lips This is our place Craster keeps us safe Better to die free than live a slave

Slave muttered the raven

Mormont leaned forward Every village we have passed has been abandoned Yours are the first living faces we’ve seen since we left the Wall The people are gone… whether dead fled or taken I could not say The animals as well Nothing is left And earlier we found the bodies of two of Ben Stark’s rangers only a few leagues from the Wall They were pale and cold with black hands and black feet and wounds that did not bleed Yet when we took them back to Castle Black they rose in the night and killed One slew Ser Jaremy Rykker and the other came for me which tells me that they remember some of what they knew when they lived but there was no human mercy left in them

The woman’s mouth hung open a wet pink cave but Craster only gave a snort We’ve had no such troubles here… and I’ll thank you not to tell such evil tales under my roof I’m a godly man and the gods keep me safe If wights come walking I’ll know how to send them back to their graves Though I could use me a sharp new axe He sent his wife scurrying with a slap on her leg and a shout of More beer and be quick about it

No trouble from the dead Jarmen Buckwell said but what of the living my lord What of your king

King cried Mormont’s raven King king king

That Mance Rayder Craster spit into the fire King-beyond-the-Wall What do free folk want with kings He turned his squint on Mormont There’s much I could tell you o’ Rayder and his doings if I had a mind This o’ the empty villages that’s his work You would have found this hall abandoned as well if I were a man to scrape to such He sends a rider tells me I must leave my own keep to come grovel at his feet I sent the man back but kept his tongue It’s nailed to that wall there He pointed Might be that I could tell you where to seek Mance Rayder If I had a mind The brown smile again But we’ll have time enough for that You’ll be wanting to sleep beneath my roof belike and eat me out of pigs

A roof would be most welcome my lord Mormont said We’ve had hard riding and too much wet

Then you’ll guest here for a night No longer I’m not that fond o’ crows The loft’s for me and mine but you’ll have all the floor you like I’ve meat and beer for twenty no more The rest o’ your black crows can peck after their own corn

We’ve packed in our own supplies my lord said the Old Bear We should be pleased to share our food and wine

Craster wiped his drooping mouth with the back of a hairy hand I’ll taste your wine Lord Crow that I will One more thing Any man lays a hand on my wives he loses the hand

Your roof your rule said Thoren Smallwood and Lord Mormont nodded stiffly though he looked none too pleased

That’s settled then Craster grudged them a grunt D’ya have a man can draw a map

Sam Tarly can Jon pushed forward Sam loves maps

Mormont beckoned him closer Send him here after he’s eaten Have him bring quill and parchment And find Tollett as well Tell him to bring my axe A guest gift for our host

Who’s this one now Craster said before Jon could go He has the look of a Stark
