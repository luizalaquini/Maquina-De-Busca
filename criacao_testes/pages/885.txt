She drew back That’s not funny

Do you hear me chuckling

Did you leave your wits at Riverrun Her voice had an edge to it Tommen’s throne derives from Robert you know that

He’ll have Casterly Rock isn’t that enough Let Father sit the throne All I want is you He made to touch her cheek Old habits die hard and it was his right arm he lifted

Cersei recoiled from his stump Don’t… don’t talk like this You’re scaring me Jaime Don’t be stupid One wrong word and you’ll cost us everything What did they do to you

They cut off my hand

No it’s more you’re changed She backed off a step We’ll talk later On the morrow I have Sansa Stark’s maids in a tower cell I need to question them… you should go to Father

I crossed a thousand leagues to come to you and lost the best part of me along the way Don’t tell me to leave

Leave me she repeated turning away

Jaime laced up his breeches and did as she commanded Weary as he was he could not seek a bed By now his lord father knew that he was back in the city

The Tower of the Hand was guarded by Lannister household guards who knew him at once The gods are good to give you back to us ser one said as he held the door

The gods had no part in it Catelyn Stark gave me back Her and the Lord of the Dreadfort

He climbed the stairs and pushed into the solar unannounced to find his father sitting by the fire Lord Tywin was alone for which Jaime was thankful He had no desire to flaunt his maimed hand for Mace Tyrell or the Red Viper just now much less the two of them together

Jaime Lord Tywin said as if they’d last seen each other at breakfast Lord Bolton led me to expect you earlier I had hoped you’d be here for the wedding

I was delayed Jaime closed the door softly My sister outdid herself I’m told Seventy-seven courses and a regicide never a wedding like it How long have you known I was free

The eunuch told me a few days after your escape I sent men into the riverlands to look for you Gregor Clegane Samwell Spicer the brothers Plumm Varys put out the word as well but quietly We agreed that the fewer people who knew you were free the fewer would be hunting you

Did Varys mention this He moved closer to the fire to let his father see

Lord Tywin pushed himself out of his chair breath hissing between his teeth Who did this If Lady Catelyn thinks—

Lady Catelyn held a sword to my throat and made me swear to return her daughters This was your goat’s work Vargo Hoat the Lord of Harrenhal

Lord Tywin looked away disgusted No longer Ser Gregor’s taken the castle The sellswords deserted their erstwhile captain almost to a man and some of Lady Whent’s old people opened a postern gate Clegane found Hoat sitting alone in the Hall of a Hundred Hearths half-mad with pain and fever from a wound that festered His ear I’m told

Jaime had to laugh Too sweet His ear He could scarcely wait to tell Brienne though the wench wouldn’t find it half so funny as he did Is he dead yet

Soon They have taken off his hands and feet but Clegane seems amused by the way the Qohorik slobbers

Jaime’s smile curdled What about his Brave Companions

The few who stayed at Harrenhal are dead The others scattered They’ll make for ports I’ll warrant or try and lose themselves in the woods His eyes went back to Jaime’s stump and his mouth grew taut with fury We’ll have their heads Every one Can you use a sword with your left hand

I can hardly dress myself in the morning Jaime held up the hand in question for his father’s inspection Four fingers a thumb much like the other Why shouldn’t it work as well

Good His father sat That is good I have a gift for you For your return After Varys told me…

Unless it’s a new hand let it wait Jaime took the chair across from him How did Joffrey die
