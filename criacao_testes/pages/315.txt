Oh I think not Varys said swirling the wine in his cup Power is a curious thing my lord Perchance you have considered the riddle I posed you that day in the inn

It has crossed my mind a time or two Tyrion admitted The king the priest the rich man—who lives and who dies Who will the swordsman obey It’s a riddle without an answer or rather too many answers All depends on the man with the sword

And yet he is no one Varys said He has neither crown nor gold nor favor of the gods only a piece of pointed steel

That piece of steel is the power of life and death

Just so… yet if it is the swordsmen who rule us in truth why do we pretend our kings hold the power Why should a strong man with a sword ever obey a child king like Joffrey or a wine-sodden oaf like his father 

Because these child kings and drunken oafs can call other strong men with other swords

Then these other swordsmen have the true power Or do they Whence came their swords Why do they obey Varys smiled Some say knowledge is power Some tell us that all power comes from the gods Others say it derives from law Yet that day on the steps of Baelor’s Sept our godly High Septon and the lawful Queen Regent and your ever-so-knowledgeable servant were as powerless as any cobbler or cooper in the crowd Who truly killed Eddard Stark do you think Joffrey who gave the command Ser Ilyn Payne who swung the sword Or… another 

Tyrion cocked his head sideways Did you mean to answer your damned riddle or only to make my head ache worse

Varys smiled Here then Power resides where men believe it resides No more and no less

So power is a mummer’s trick

A shadow on the wall Varys murmured yet shadows can kill And ofttimes a very small man can cast a very large shadow

Tyrion smiled Lord Varys I am growing strangely fond of you I may kill you yet but I think I’d feel sad about it

I will take that as high praise

What are you Varys Tyrion found he truly wanted to know A spider they say

Spies and informers are seldom loved my lord I am but a loyal servant of the realm

And a eunuch Let us not forget that

I seldom do

People have called me a halfman too yet I think the gods have been kinder to me I am small my legs are twisted and women do not look upon me with any great yearning… yet I’m still a man Shae is not the first to grace my bed and one day I may take a wife and sire a son If the gods are good he’ll look like his uncle and think like his father You have no such hope to sustain you Dwarfs are a jape of the gods… but men make eunuchs Who cut you Varys When and why Who are you truly

The eunuch’s smile never flickered but his eyes glittered with something that was not laughter You are kind to ask my lord but my tale is long and sad and we have treasons to discuss He drew a parchment from the sleeve of his robe The master of the King’s Galley White Hart plots to slip anchor three days hence to offer his sword and ship to Lord Stannis

Tyrion sighed I suppose we must make some sort of bloody lesson out of the man

Ser Jacelyn could arrange for him to vanish but a trial before the king would help assure the continued loyalty of the other captains

And keep my royal nephew occupied as well As you say Put him down for a dose of Joffrey’s justice

Varys made a mark on the parchment Ser Horas and Ser Hobber Redwyne have bribed a guard to let them out a postern gate the night after next Arrangements have been made for them to sail on the Pentoshi galley Moonrunner disguised as oarsmen

Can we keep them on those oars for a few years see how they fancy it He smiled No my sister would be distraught to lose such treasured guests Inform Ser Jacelyn Seize the man they bribed and explain what an honor it is to serve as a brother of the Night’s Watch And have men posted around the Moonrunner in case the Redwynes find a second guard short of coin

As you will Another mark on the parchment Your man Timett slew a wineseller’s son this evening at a gambling den on the Street of Silver He accused him of cheating at tiles

Was it true

Oh beyond a doubt
