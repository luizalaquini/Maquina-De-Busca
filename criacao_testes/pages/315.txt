the king All that thou didst send for to thy servant at the first I
will do but this thing I may not do And the messengers departed and
brought him word again

2010 And Benhadad sent unto him and said The gods do so unto me
and more also if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for
all the people that follow me

2011 And the king of Israel answered and said Tell him Let not him
that girdeth on his harness boast himself as he that putteth it off

2012 And it came to pass when Ben-hadad heard this message as he
was drinking he and the kings in the pavilions that he said unto his
servants Set yourselves in array And they set themselves in array
against the city

2013 And behold there came a prophet unto Ahab king of Israel
saying Thus saith the LORD Hast thou seen all this great multitude
behold I will deliver it into thine hand this day and thou shalt
know that I am the LORD

2014 And Ahab said By whom And he said Thus saith the LORD Even
by the young men of the princes of the provinces Then he said Who
shall order the battle And he answered Thou

2015 Then he numbered the young men of the princes of the provinces
and they were two hundred and thirty two and after them he numbered
all the people even all the children of Israel being seven thousand

2016 And they went out at noon But Benhadad was drinking himself
drunk in the pavilions he and the kings the thirty and two kings
that helped him

2017 And the young men of the princes of the provinces went out
first and Benhadad sent out and they told him saying There are men
come out of Samaria

2018 And he said Whether they be come out for peace take them
alive or whether they be come out for war take them alive

2019 So these young men of the princes of the provinces came out of
the city and the army which followed them

2020 And they slew every one his man and the Syrians fled and
Israel pursued them and Benhadad the king of Syria escaped on an
horse with the horsemen

2021 And the king of Israel went out and smote the horses and
chariots and slew the Syrians with a great slaughter

2022 And the prophet came to the king of Israel and said unto him
Go strengthen thyself and mark and see what thou doest for at the
return of the year the king of Syria will come up against thee

2023 And the servants of the king of Syria said unto him Their gods
are gods of the hills therefore they were stronger than we but let
us fight against them in the plain and surely we shall be stronger
than they

2024 And do this thing Take the kings away every man out of his
place and put captains in their rooms 2025 And number thee an army
like the army that thou hast lost horse for horse and chariot for
chariot and we will fight against them in the plain and surely we
shall be stronger than they And he hearkened unto their voice and
did so

2026 And it came to pass at the return of the year that Benhadad
numbered the Syrians and went up to Aphek to fight against Israel

2027 And the children of Israel were numbered and were all present
and went against them and the children of Israel pitched before them
like two little flocks of kids but the Syrians filled the country

2028 And there came a man of God and spake unto the king of Israel
and said Thus saith the LORD Because the Syrians have said The LORD
is God of the hills but he is not God of the valleys therefore will
I deliver all this great multitude into thine hand and ye shall know
that I am the LORD

2029 And they pitched one over against the other seven days And so
it was that in the seventh day the battle was joined and the
children of Israel slew of the Syrians an hundred thousand footmen in
one day

2030 But the rest fled to Aphek into the city and there a wall fell
upon twenty and seven thousand of the men that were left And Benhadad
fled and came into the city into an inner chamber

2031 And his servants said unto him Behold now we have heard that
the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings let us I pray
thee put sackcloth on our loins and ropes upon our heads and go out
to the king of Israel peradventure he will save thy life

2032 So they girded sackcloth on their loins and put ropes on their
heads and came to the king of Israel and said Thy servant Benhadad
saith I pray thee let me live And he said Is he yet alive he is
my brother

2033 Now the men did diligently observe whether any thing would come
from him and did hastily catch it and they said Thy brother
