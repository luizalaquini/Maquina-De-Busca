roof across from our former hideout Shells are launched
into the row of apartments setting off the chain of
explosions we heard and the building collapses into rubble
and dust
Now we cut to a live feed A reporter stands on the roof
with the Peacekeepers Behind her the apartment block
burns Firefighters try to control the blaze with water hoses
We are pronounced dead
Finally a bit of luck says Homes
I guess hes right Certainly its better than having the
Capitol in pursuit of us But I just keep imagining how this
will be playing back in 13 Where my mother and Prim
Hazelle and the kids Annie Haymitch and a whole lot of
people from 13 think that they have just seen us die
My father He just lost my sister and now says Leeg

We watch as they play the footage over and over
Revel in their victory especially over me Break away to do
a montage of the Mockingjays rise to rebel power--I think
theyve had this part prepared for a while because it
seems pretty polished--and then go live so a couple of
reporters can discuss my well-deserved violent end Later
they promise Snow will make an official statement The
screen fades back to a glow
The rebels made no attempt to break in during the
broadcast which leads me to believe they think its true If
thats so we really are on our own
So now that were dead whats our next move asks
Gale
Isnt it obvious No one even knew Peeta had
regained consciousness I dont know how long hes been
watching but by the look of misery on his face long enough
to see what happened on the street How he went mad
tried to bash my head in and hurled Mitchell into the pod
He painfully pushes himself up to a sitting position and
directs his words to Gale
Our next moveis to kill me
21
That makes two requests for Peetas death in less than
an hour
Dont be ridiculous says Jackson
I just murdered a member of our squad shouts
Peeta
You pushed him off you You couldnt have known he
would trigger the net at that exact spot says Finnick trying
to calm him
Who cares Hes dead isnt he Tears begin to run
down Peetas face I didnt know Ive never seen myself
like that before Katniss is right Im the monster Im the
mutt Im the one Snow has turned into a weapon
Its not your fault Peeta says Finnick
You cant take me with you Its only a matter of time
before I kill someone else Peeta looks around at our
conflicted faces Maybe you think its kinder to just dump
me somewhere Let me take my chances But thats the
same thing as handing me over to the Capitol Do you think
youd be doing me a favor by sending me back to Snow
Peeta Back in Snows hands Tortured and tormented
until no bits of his former self will ever emerge again
For some reason the last stanza to The Hanging
Tree starts running through my head The one where the
man wants his lover dead rather than have her face the evil
that awaits her in the world
Are you are you
Coming to the tree
Wear a necklace of rope side by side with
me
Strange things did happen here
No stranger would it be
If we met up at midnight in the hanging tree
Ill kill you before that happens says Gale I
promise
Peeta hesitates as if considering the reliability of this
offer and then shakes his head Its no good What if
youre not there to do it I want one of those poison pills like
the rest of you have
Nightlock Theres one pill back at camp in its special
slot on the sleeve of my Mockingjay suit But theres another
in the breast pocket of my uniform Interesting that they
didnt issue one to Peeta Perhaps Coin thought he might
take it before he had the opportunity to kill me Its unclear if
Peeta means hed finish himself off now to spare us having
to murder him or only if the Capitol took him prisoner
again In the state hes in I expect it would be sooner rather
than later It would certainly make things easier on the rest
of us Not to have to shoot him It would certainly simplify the
problem of dealing with his homicidal episodes
I dont know if its the pods or the fear or watching
Boggs die but I feel the arena all around me Its as if Ive
never left really Once again Im battling not only for my own
survival but for Peetas as well How satisfying how
entertaining it would be for Snow to have me kill him To
have Peetas death on my conscience for whatever is left of
my life
Its not about you I say Were on a mission And
youre necessary to it I look to the rest of the group Think
we might find some food here
Besides the medical kit and cameras we have nothing
but our uniforms and our weapons
Half of us stay to guard Peeta or keep an eye out for
