Lysa waved a hand negligently Not for many years You are too young to be a mother One day you shall want children though Just as you will want to marry

I    I am married my lady

Yes but soon a widow Be glad the Imp preferred his whores It would not be fitting for my son to take that dwarf’s leavings but as he never touched you    How would you like to marry your cousin the Lord Robert

The thought made Sansa weary All she knew of Robert Arryn was that he was a little boy and sickly It is not me she wants her son to marry it is my claim No one will ever marry me for love But lying came easy to her now I    can scarcely wait to meet him my lady But he is still a child is he not

He is eight And not robust But such a good boy so bright and clever He will be a great man Alayne The seed is strong my lord husband said before he died His last words The gods sometimes let us glimpse the future as we lay dying I see no reason why you should not be wed as soon as we know that your Lannister husband is dead A secret wedding to be sure The Lord of the Eyrie could scarcely be thought to have married a bastard that would not be fitting The ravens should bring us the word from King’s Landing once the Imp’s head rolls You and Robert can be wed the next day won’t that be joyous It will be good for him to have a little companion He played with Vardis Egen’s boy when we first returned to the Eyrie and my steward’s sons as well but they were much too rough and I had no choice but to send them away Do you read well Alayne

Septa Mordane was good enough to say so

Robert has weak eyes but he loves to be read to Lady Lysa confided He likes stories about animals the best Do you know the little song about the chicken who dressed as a fox I sing him that all the time he never grows tired of it And he likes to play hopfrog and spin-the-sword and come-into-my-castle but you must always let him win That’s only proper don’t you think He is the Lord of the Eyrie after all you must never forget that You are well born and the Starks of Winterfell were always proud but Winterfell has fallen and you are really just a beggar now so put that pride aside Gratitude will better become you in your present circumstances Yes and obedience My son will have a grateful and obedient wife





JON

Day and night the axes rang

Jon could not remember the last time he had slept When he closed his eyes he dreamed of fighting when he woke he fought Even in the King’s Tower he could hear the ceaseless thunk of bronze and flint and stolen steel biting into wood and it was louder when he tried to rest in the warming shed atop the Wall Mance had sledgehammers at work as well and long saws with teeth of bone and flint Once as he was drifting off into an exhausted sleep there came a great cracking from the haunted forest and a sentinel tree came crashing down in a cloud of dirt and needles

He was awake when Owen came to him lying restless under a pile of furs on the floor of the warming shed Lord Snow said Owen shaking his shoulder the dawn He gave Jon a hand to help pull him back onto his feet Others were waking as well jostling one another as they pulled on their boots and buckled their swordbelts in the close confines of the shed No one spoke They were all too tired for talk Few of them ever left the Wall these days It took too long to ride up and down in the cage Castle Black had been abandoned to Maester Aemon Ser Wynton Stout and a few others too old or ill to fight

I had a dream that the king had come Owen said happily Maester Aemon sent a raven and King Robert came with all his strength I dreamed I saw his golden banners

Jon made himself smile That would be a welcome sight to see Owen Ignoring the twinge of pain in his leg he swept a black fur cloak about his shoulders gathered up his crutch and went out onto the Wall to face another day

A gust of wind sent icy tendrils wending through his long brown hair Half a mile north the wildling encampments were stirring their campfires sending up smoky fingers to scratch against the pale dawn sky Along the edge of the forest they had raised their tents of hide and fur even a crude longhall of logs and woven branches there were horselines to the east mammoths to the west and men everywhere sharpening their swords putting points on crude spears donning makeshift armor of hide and horn and bone For every man that he could see Jon knew there were a score unseen in the wood The brush gave them some shelter from the elements and hid them from the eyes of the hated crows

Already their archers were stealing forward pushing their rolling mantlets Here come our breakfast arrows Pyp announced cheerfully as he did every morning It’s good that he can make a jape of it Jon thought Someone has to Three days ago one of those breakfast arrows had caught Red Alyn of the Rosewood in the leg You could still see his body at the foot of the Wall if you cared to lean out far enough Jon had to think that it was better for them to smile at Pyp’s jest than to brood over Alyn’s corpse

The mantlets were slanting wooden shields wide enough for five of the free folk to hide behind The archers pushed them close then knelt behind them to loose their arrows through slits in the wood The first time the wildlings rolled them out Jon had called for fire arrows and set a half-dozen ablaze but after that Mance started covering them with raw hides All the fire arrows in the world couldn’t make them catch now The brothers had even started wagering as to which of the straw sentinels would collect the most arrows before they were done Dolorous Edd was leading with four but Othell Yarwyck Tumberjon and Watt of Long Lake had three apiece It was Pyp who’d started naming the scarecrows after their missing brothers too It makes it seem as if there’s more of us he said

More of us with arrows in our bellies Grenn complained but the custom did seem to give his brothers heart so Jon let the names stand and the wagering continue

On the edge of the Wall an ornate brass Myrish eye stood on three spindly legs Maester Aemon had once used it to peer at the stars before his own eyes had failed him Jon swung the tube down to have a look at the foe Even at this distance there was no mistaking Mance Rayder’s huge white tent sewn together from the pelts of snow bears The Myrish lenses brought the wildlings close enough for him to make out faces Of Mance himself he saw no sign this morning but his woman Dalla was outside tending the fire while her sister Val milked a she-goat beside the tent Dalla looked so big it was a wonder she could move The child must be coming very soon Jon thought He swiveled the eye east and searched amongst the tents and trees till he found the turtle That will be coming very soon as well The wildlings had skinned one of the dead mammoths during the night and they were lashing the raw bloody hide over the turtle’s roof one more layer on top of the sheepskins and pelts The turtle had a rounded top and eight huge wheels and under the hides was a stout wooden frame When the wildlings had begun knocking it together Satin thought they were building a ship Not far wrong The turtle was a hull turned upside down and opened fore and aft a longhall on wheels

It’s done isn’t it asked Grenn

Near enough Jon shoved away the eye It will come today most like Did you fill the barrels

Every one They froze hard during the night Pyp checked

Grenn had changed a great deal from the big clumsy red-necked boy Jon had first befriended He had grown half a foot his chest and shoulders had thickened and he had not cut his hair nor trimmed his beard since the Fist of the First Men It made him look as huge and shaggy as an aurochs the mocking name that Ser Alliser Thorne had hung on him during training He looked weary now though When Jon said as much he nodded I heard their axes all night Couldn’t sleep for all the chopping

Then go sleep now

I don’t need—

You do I want you rested Go on I’m not going to let you sleep through the fight He made himself smile You’re the only one who can move those bloody barrels

Grenn went off muttering and Jon returned to the far eye searching the wildling camp From time to time an arrow would sail past overhead but he had learned to ignore those The range was long and the angle was bad the chances of being hit were small He still saw no sign of Mance Rayder in the camp but he spied Tormund Giantsbane and two of his sons around the turtle The sons were struggling with the mammoth hide while Tormund gnawed on the roast leg of a goat and bellowed orders Elsewhere he found the wildling skinchanger Varamyr Sixskins walking through the trees with his shadowcat dogging his heels

When he heard the rattle of the winch chains and the iron groan of the cage door opening he knew it would be Hobb bringing their breakfast as he did every morning The sight of Mance’s turtle had robbed Jon of his appetite Their oil was all but gone and the last barrel of pitch had been rolled off the Wall two nights ago They would soon run short of arrows as well and there were no fletchers making more And the night before last a raven had come from the west from Ser Denys Mallister Bowen Marsh had chased the wildlings all the way to the Shadow Tower it seemed and then farther down into the gloom of the Gorge At the Bridge of Skulls he had met the Weeper and three hundred wildlings and won a bloody battle But the victory had been a costly one More than a hundred brothers slain among them Ser Endrew Tarth and Ser Aladale Wynch The Old Pomegranate himself had been carried back to the Shadow Tower sorely wounded Maester Mullin was tending him but it would be some time before he was fit to return to Castle Black

When he had read that Jon had dispatched Zei to Mole’s Town on their best horse to plead with the villagers to help man the Wall She never returned When he sent Mully after her he came back to report the whole village deserted even the brothel Most likely Zei had followed them straight down the kingsroad Maybe we should all do the same Jon reflected glumly

He made himself eat hungry or no Bad enough he could not sleep he could not go on without food as well Besides this might be my last meal It might be the last meal for all of us So it was that Jon had a belly full of bread bacon onions and cheese when he heard Horse shout IT’S COMING

No one needed to ask what it was Nor did Jon need the maester’s Myrish eye to see it creeping out from amongst the tents and trees It doesn’t really look much like a turtle Satin commented Turtles don’t have fur

Most of them don’t have wheels either said Pyp

Sound the warhorn Jon commanded and Kegs blew two long blasts to wake Grenn and the other sleepers who’d had the watch during the night If the wildlings were coming the Wall would need every man Gods know we have few enough Jon looked at Pyp and Kegs and Satin Horse and Owen the Oaf Tim Tangletongue Mully Spare Boot and the rest and tried to imagine them going belly to belly and blade to blade against a hundred screaming wildlings in the freezing darkness of that tunnel with only a few iron bars between them That was what it would come down to unless they could stop the turtle before the gate was breached

It’s big Horse said

Pyp smacked his lips Think of all the soup it will make The jape was stillborn Even Pyp sounded tired He looks half dead thought Jon but so do we all The King-beyond-the-Wall had so many men that he could throw fresh attackers at them every time but the same handful of black brothers had to meet every assault and it had worn them ragged

The men beneath the wood and hides would be pulling hard Jon knew putting their shoulders into it straining to keep the wheels turning but once the turtle was flush against the gate they would exchange their ropes for axes At least Mance was not sending his mammoths today Jon was glad of that Their awesome strength was wasted on the Wall and their size only made them easy targets The last had been a day and a half in the dying its mournful trumpetings terrible to hear

The turtle crept slowly through stones and stumps and brush The earlier attacks had cost the free folk a hundred lives or more Most still lay where they had fallen In the lulls the crows would come and pay them court but now the birds fled screeching They liked the look of that turtle no more than he did

Satin Horse and the others were looking to him Jon knew waiting for his orders He was so tired he hardly knew any more The Wall is mine he reminded himself Owen Horse to the catapults Kegs you and Spare Boot on the scorpions The rest of you string your bows Fire arrows Let’s see if we can burn it It was likely to be a futile gesture Jon knew but it had to be better than standing helpless

Cumbersome and slow-moving the turtle made for an easy shot and his archers and crossbowmen soon turned it into a lumbering wooden hedgehog    but the wet hides protected it just as they had the mantlets and the flaming arrows guttered out almost as soon as they struck Jon cursed under his breath Scorpions he commanded Catapults

The scorpions bolts punched deep into the pelts but did no more damage than the fire arrows The rocks went bouncing off the turtle’s roof leaving dimples in the thick layers of hides A stone from one of the trebuchets might have crushed it but the one machine was still broken and the wildlings had gone wide around the area where the other dropped its loads

Jon it’s still coming said Owen the Oaf

He could see that for himself Inch by inch yard by yard the turtle crept closer rolling rumbling and rocking as it crossed the killing ground Once the wildlings got it flush against the Wall it would give them all the shelter they needed while their axes crashed through the hastily-repaired outer gates Inside under the ice they would clear the loose rubble from the tunnel in a matter of hours and then there would be nothing to stop them but two iron gates a few half-frozen corpses and whatever brothers Jon cared to throw in their path to fight and die down in the dark

To his left the catapult made a thunk and filled the air with spinning stones They plonked down on the turtle like hail and caromed harmlessly aside The wildling archers were still loosing arrows from behind their mantlets One thudded into the face of a straw man and Pyp said Four for Watt of Long Lake We have a tie The next shaft whistled past his own ear however Fie he shouted down I’m not in the tourney

The hides won’t burn Jon said as much to himself as to the others Their only hope was to try and crush the turtle when it reached the Wall For that they needed boulders No matter how stoutly built the turtle was a huge chunk of rock crashing straight down on top of it from seven hundred feet was bound to do some damage Grenn Owen Kegs it’s time

Alongside the warming shed a dozen stout oaken barrels were lined up in a row They were full of crushed rock the gravel that the black brothers customarily spread on the footpaths to give themselves better footing atop the Wall Yesterday after he’d seen the free folk covering the turtle with sheepskins Jon told Grenn to pour water into the barrels as much as they would take The water would seep down through the crushed stone and overnight the whole thing would freeze solid It was the nearest thing to a boulder they were going to get

Why do we need to freeze it Grenn had asked him Why don’t we just roll the barrels off the way they are

Jon answered If they crash against the Wall on the way down they’ll burst and loose gravel will spray everywhere We don’t want to rain pebbles on the whoresons

He put his shoulder to the one barrel with Grenn while Kegs and Owen were wrestling with another Together they rocked it back and forth to break the grip of the ice that had formed around its bottom The bugger weighs a ton said Grenn

Tip it over and roll it Jon said Careful if it rolls over your foot you’ll end up like Spare Boot
