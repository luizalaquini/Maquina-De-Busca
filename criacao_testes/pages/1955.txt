5  quantities which specify how to calculate boundary values for
amplitudes
LE
This table is rather large  There are 80 segments in all remember
that many phonemes are represented by more than one segment
and so it has 2000 entries  The system was an offline one which ran on
what was then em 1964 em a large computer
pp
The advantage of such a large table of rules is the
flexibility it affords
Notice that transition durations are specified independently for
formant frequency and amplitude parameters em this permits
fine control which is particularly useful for stops
For each parameter the boundary value between segments is calculated
using a fixed contribution from the dominant one
and a proportion of the steady state value of the other
pp
It is possible that the two transition durations which are
calculated for a segment actually exceed the overall duration specified
for it  In this case the steady-state target values will be approached
but not actually attained simulating a situation where coarticulation
effects prevent a target value from being reached
rh An event-based system
The synthesis system described above in common with many others takes
an uncompromisingly segment-by-segment view of speech
The next phoneme is read perhaps split into a few segments and
these are synthesized one by one with due attention being paid
to transitions between them
Some later work has taken a more syllabic view
Mattingly 1976 urges a return to syllables for both practical and
theoretical reasons

Mattingly 1976 Syllable synthesis

Transitional effects are particularly strong
within a syllable and comparatively weak but by no means negligible
from one syllable to the next  From a theoretical viewpoint
there are much stronger phonetic restrictions on phoneme sequences
than there are on syllable sequences  pretty well any syllable can
follow another although whether the pair makes sense is
a different matter but the linguistically
acceptable phoneme sequences are only a fraction
of those formed by combining phonemes in all
possible ways
Hill 1978 argues against what be calls the segmental assumption
that progress through the utterance should be made one segment at a time
and recommends a description of speech based upon perceptually relevant
events

Hill 1978 A program structure for event-based speech synthesis by rules

This framework is interesting because it provides an opportunity for prosodic
considerations to be treated as an integral part of the synthesis
process
pp
The phonetic segments and other information that specify an utterance
can be regarded as a list of events which describes it
at a relatively high level
Synthesis-by-rule is the act of taking this list and elaborating on it
to produce lower-level events which are realized by the vocal tract
or acoustically simulated by a resonance synthesizer to give a speech
waveform
In articulatory terms an event might be begin tongue motion towards
upper teeth with a given effort while in resonance terms it could be
begin second formant transition towards 1500 Hz at a given rate
These two examples are
ul
not
intended to describe the same event  a tongue motion causes much more
than the transition of a single formant  Coarticulation
issues such as stop burst suppression and nasal plosion should
be easier to imitate within an event-based scheme than a segment-to-segment
one

The ISP system Witten and Abbess 1979 is event-based

To prepare an utterance for synthesis the lexical items which specify
it are joined into a linked list  Figure 73 shows the start of

Next the rhythm and pitch assignment routines
augment the list with syllable boundaries phoneme
cluster identifiers and duration and pitch specifications
Then it is passed to the segmental synthesis routine
which chains events into the appropriate places and as it
proceeds removes the no longer useful elements phoneme names
pitch specifiers etc which originally constituted the synthesis list
