No less do I love mine

Ned thought If it came to that the life of some child I did not know against Robb and Sansa and Arya and Bran and Rickon what would I do Even more so what would Catelyn do if it were Jon’s life against the children of her body He did not know He prayed he never would

All three are Jaime’s he said It was not a question

Thank the gods

The seed is strong Jon Arryn had cried on his deathbed and so it was All those bastards all with hair as black as night Grand Maester Malleon recorded the last mating between stag and lion some ninety years ago when Tya Lannister wed Gowen Baratheon third son of the reigning lord Their only issue an unnamed boy described in Malleon’s tome as a large and lusty lad born with a full head of black hair died in infancy Thirty years before that a male Lannister had taken a Baratheon maid to wife She had given him three daughters and a son each black-haired No matter how far back Ned searched in the brittle yellowed pages always he found the gold yielding before the coal

A dozen years Ned said How is it that you have had no children by the king

She lifted her head defiant Your Robert got me with child once she said her voice thick with contempt My brother found a woman to cleanse me He never knew If truth be told I can scarcely bear for him to touch me and I have not let him inside me for years I know other ways to pleasure him when he leaves his whores long enough to stagger up to my bedchamber Whatever we do the king is usually so drunk that he’s forgotten it all by the next morning

How could they have all been so blind The truth was there in front of them all the time written on the children’s faces Ned felt sick I remember Robert as he was the day he took the throne every inch a king he said quietly A thousand other women might have loved him with all their hearts What did he do to make you hate him so

Her eyes burned green fire in the dusk like the lioness that was her sigil The night of our wedding feast the first time we shared a bed he called me by your sister’s name He was on top of me in me stinking of wine and he whispered Lyanna

Ned Stark thought of pale blue roses and for a moment he wanted to weep I do not know which of you I pity most

The queen seemed amused by that Save your pity for yourself Lord Stark I want none of it

You know what I must do

Must She put her hand on his good leg just above the knee A true man does what he will not what he must Her fingers brushed lightly against his thigh the gentlest of promises The realm needs a strong Hand Joff will not come of age for years No one wants war again least of all me Her hand touched his face his hair If friends can turn to enemies enemies can become friends Your wife is a thousand leagues away and my brother has fled Be kind to me Ned I swear to you you shall never regret it

Did you make the same offer to Jon Arryn

She slapped him

I shall wear that as a badge of honor Ned said dryly

Honor she spat How dare you play the noble lord with me What do you take me for You’ve a bastard of your own I’ve seen him Who was the mother I wonder Some Dornish peasant you raped while her holdfast burned A whore Or was it the grieving sister the Lady Ashara She threw herself into the sea I’m told Why was that For the brother you slew or the child you stole Tell me my honorable Lord Eddard how are you any different from Robert or me or Jaime

For a start said Ned I do not kill children You would do well to listen my lady I shall say this only once When the king returns from his hunt I intend to lay the truth before him You must be gone by then You and your children all three and not to Casterly Rock If I were you I should take ship for the Free Cities or even farther to the Summer Isles or the Port of Ibben As far as the winds blow

Exile she said A bitter cup to drink from

A sweeter cup than your father served Rhaegar’s children Ned said and kinder than you deserve Your father and your brothers would do well to go with you Lord Tywin’s gold will buy you comfort and hire swords to keep you safe You shall need them I promise you no matter where you flee Robert’s wrath will follow you to the back of beyond if need be

The queen stood And what of my wrath Lord Stark she asked softly Her eyes searched his face You should have taken the realm for yourself It was there for the taking Jaime told me how you found him on the Iron Throne the day King’s Landing fell and made him yield it up That was your moment All you needed to do was climb those steps and sit Such a sad mistake

I have made more mistakes than you can possibly imagine Ned said but that was not one of them

Oh but it was my lord Cersei insisted When you play the game of thrones you win or you die There is no middle ground

She turned up her hood to hide her swollen face and left him there in the dark beneath the oak amidst the quiet of the godswood under a blue-black sky The stars were coming out
