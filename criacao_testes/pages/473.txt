The kiss aroused him as her kisses always did but this time Tyrion gently disentangled himself Not now Sweetling I have… well call it the seed of a plan I think I might be able to bring you into the castle kitchens

Shae’s face went still The kitchens

Yes If I act through Varys no one will be the wiser

She giggled M’lord I’d poison you Every man who’s tasted my cooking has told me what a good whore I am

The Red Keep has sufficient cooks Butchers and bakers too You’d need to pose as a scullion

A pot girl she said in scratchy brown roughspun Is that how m’lord wants to see me

M’lord wants to see you alive Tyrion said You can scarcely scour pots in silk and velvet

Has m’lord grown tired of me She reached a hand under his tunic and found his cock In two quick strokes she had it hard He still wants me She laughed Would you like to fuck your kitchen wench m’lord You can dust me with flour and suck gravy off my titties if you…

Stop it The way she was acting reminded him of Dancy who had tried so hard to win her wager He yanked her hand away to keep her from further mischief This is not the time for bed sport Shae Your life may be at stake

Her grin was gone If I’ve displeased m’lord I never meant it only… couldn’t you just give me more guards

Tyrion breathed a deep sigh Remember how young she is he told himself He took her hand Your gems can be replaced and new gowns can be sewn twice as lovely as the old To me you’re the most precious thing within these walls The Red Keep is not safe either but it’s a deal safer than here I want you there

In the kitchens Her voice was flat Scouring pots

For a short while

My father made me his kitchen wench she said her mouth twisting That was why I ran off

You told me you ran off because your father made you his whore he reminded her

That too I didn’t like scouring his pots no more than I liked his cock in me She tossed her head Why can’t you keep me in your tower Half the lords at court keep bedwarmers

I was expressly forbidden to take you to court

By your stupid father Shae pouted You’re old enough to keep all the whores you want Does he take you for a beardless boy What could he do spank you

He slapped her Not hard but hard enough Damn you he said Damn you Never mock me Not you

For a moment Shae did not speak The only sound was the cricket chirping chirping Beg pardon m’lord she said at last in a heavy wooden voice I never meant to be impudent

And I never meant to strike you Gods be good am I turning into Cersei That was ill done he said On both our parts Shae you do not understand Words he had never meant to speak came tumbling out of him like mummers from a hollow horse When I was thirteen I wed a crofter’s daughter Or so I thought her I was blind with love for her and thought she felt the same for me but my father rubbed my face in the truth My bride was a whore Jaime had hired to give me my first taste of manhood And I believed all of it fool that I was To drive the lesson home Lord Tywin gave my wife to a barracks of his guardsmen to use as they pleased and commanded me to watch And to take her one last time after the rest were done One last time with no trace of love or tenderness remaining So you will remember her as she truly is he said and I should have defied him but my cock betrayed me and I did as I was bid After he was done with her my father had the marriage undone It was as if we had never been wed the septons said He squeezed her hand Please let’s have no more talk of the Tower of the Hand You will be in the kitchens only a little while Once we’re done with Stannis you’ll have another manse and silks as soft as your hands

Shae’s eyes had grown large but he could not read what lay behind them My hands won’t be soft if I clean ovens and scrape plates all day Will you still want them touching you when they’re all red and raw and cracked from hot water and lye soap

More than ever he said When I look at them they’ll remind me how brave you were

He could not say if she believed him She lowered her eyes I am yours to command m’lord

It was as much acceptance as she could give tonight he saw that plain enough He kissed her cheek where he’d struck her to take some sting from the blow I will send for you

Varys was waiting in the stables as promised His horse looked spavined and half-dead Tyrion mounted up one of the sellswords opened the gates They rode out in silence Why did I tell her about Tysha gods help me he asked himself suddenly afraid There were some secrets that should never be spoken some shames a man should take to his grave What did he want from her forgiveness The way she had looked at him what did that mean Did she hate the thought of scouring pots that much or was it his confession How could I tell her that and still think she would love me part of him said and another part mocked saying Fool of a dwarf it is only the gold and jewels the whore loves

His scarred elbow was throbbing jarred every time the horse set down a hoof Sometimes he could almost fancy he heard the bones grinding together inside Perhaps he should see a maester get some potion for the pain… but since Pycelle had revealed himself for what he was Tyrion Lannister mistrusted the maesters The gods only knew who they were conspiring with or what they had mixed in those potions they gave you Varys he said I need to bring Shae into the castle without Cersei becoming aware Briefly he sketched out his kitchen scheme
