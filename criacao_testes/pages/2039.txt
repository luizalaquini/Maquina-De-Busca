The one-armed woman died at evenfall Gendry and Cutjack dug her grave on a hillside beneath a weeping willow When the wind blew Arya thought she could hear the long trailing branches whispering Please Please Please The little hairs on the back of her neck rose and she almost ran from the graveside

No fire tonight Yoren told them Supper was a handful of wild radishes Koss found a cup of dry beans water from a nearby brook The water had a funny taste to it and Lommy told them it was the taste of bodies rotting someplace upstream Hot Pie would have hit him if old Reysen hadn’t pulled them apart

Arya drank too much water just to fill her belly with something She never thought she’d be able to sleep yet somehow she did When she woke it was pitch-black and her bladder was full to bursting Sleepers huddled all around her wrapped in blankets and cloaks Arya found Needle stood listened She heard the soft footfalls of a sentry men turning in restless sleep Rorge’s rattling snores and the queer hissing sound that Biter made when he slept From a different wagon came the steady rhythmic scrape of steel on stone as Yoren sat chewing sourleaf and sharpening the edge of his dirk

Hot Pie was one of the boys on watch Where you going he asked when he saw Arya heading for the trees

Arya waved vaguely at the woods

No you’re not Hot Pie said He had gotten bolder again now that he had a sword on his belt even though it was just a shortsword and he handled it like a cleaver The old man said for everyone to stay close tonight

I need to make water Arya explained

Well use that tree right there He pointed You don’t know what’s out there Arry I heard wolves before

Yoren wouldn’t like it if she fought with him She tried to look afraid Wolves For true

I heard he assured her

I don’t think I need to go after all She went back to her blanket and pretended to sleep until she heard Hot Pie’s footsteps going away Then she rolled over and slipped off into the woods on the other side of the camp quiet as a shadow There were sentries out this way too but Arya had no trouble avoiding them Just to make sure she went out twice as far as usual When she was sure there was no one near she skinned down her breeches and squatted to do her business

She was making water her clothing tangled about her ankles when she heard rustling from under the trees Hot Pie she thought in panic he followed me Then she saw the eyes shining out from the wood bright with reflected moonlight Her belly clenched tight as she grabbed for Needle not caring if she pissed herself counting eyes two four eight twelve a whole pack   

One of them came padding out from under the trees He stared at her and bared his teeth and all she could think was how stupid she’d been and how Hot Pie would gloat when they found her half-eaten body the next morning But the wolf turned and raced back into the darkness and quick as that the eyes were gone Trembling she cleaned herself and laced up and followed a distant scraping sound back to camp and to Yoren Arya climbed up into the wagon beside him shaken Wolves she whispered hoarsely In the woods

Aye They would be He never looked at her

They scared me

Did they He spat Seems to me your kind was fond o’ wolves

Nymeria was a direwolf Arya hugged herself That’s different Anyhow she’s gone Jory and I threw rocks at her until she ran off or else the queen would have killed her It made her sad to talk about it I bet if she’d been in the city she wouldn’t have let them cut off Father’s head

Orphan boys got no fathers Yoren said or did you forget that The sourleaf had turned his spit red so it looked like his mouth was bleeding The only wolves we got to fear are the ones wear manskin like those who done for that village

I wish I was home she said miserably She tried so hard to be brave to be fierce as a wolverine and all but sometimes she felt like she was just a little girl after all

The black brother peeled a fresh sourleaf from the bale in the wagon and stuffed it into his mouth Might be I should of left you where I found you boy All of you Safer in the city seems to me

I don’t care I want to go home

Been bringing men to the Wall for close on thirty years Froth shone on Yoren’s lips like bubbles of blood All that time I only lost three Old man died of a fever city boy got snakebit taking a shit and one fool tried to kill me in my sleep and got a red smile for his trouble He drew the dirk across his throat to show her Three in thirty years He spat out the old sourleaf A ship now might have been wiser No chance o’ finding more men on the way but still    clever man he’d go by ship but me    thirty years I been taking this kingsroad He sheathed his dirk Go to sleep boy Hear me

She did try Yet as she lay under her thin blanket she could hear the wolves howling    and another sound fainter no more than a whisper on the wind that might have been screams





DAVOS

The morning air was dark with the smoke of burning gods

They were all afire now Maid and Mother Warrior and Smith the Crone with her pearl eyes and the Father with his gilded beard even the Stranger carved to look more animal than human The old dry wood and countless layers of paint and varnish blazed with a fierce hungry light Heat rose shimmering through the chill air behind the gargoyles and stone dragons on the castle walls seemed blurred as if Davos were seeing them through a veil of tears Or as if the beasts were trembling stirring   

An ill thing Allard declared though at least he had the sense to keep his voice low Dale muttered agreement

Silence said Davos Remember where you are His sons were good men but young and Allard especially was rash Had I stayed a smuggler Allard would have ended on the Wall Stannis spared him from that end something else I owe him   

Hundreds had come to the castle gates to bear witness to the burning of the Seven The smell in the air was ugly Even for soldiers it was hard not to feel uneasy at such an affront to the gods most had worshiped all their lives

The red woman walked round the fire three times praying once in the speech of Asshai once in High Valyrian and once in the Common Tongue Davos understood only the last R’hllor come to us in our darkness she called Lord of Light we offer you these false gods these seven who are one and him the enemy Take them and cast your light upon us for the night is dark and full of terrors Queen Selyse echoed the words Beside her Stannis watched impassively his jaw hard as stone under the blue-black shadow of his tight-cropped beard He had dressed more richly than was his wont as if for the sept

Dragonstone’s sept had been where Aegon the Conqueror knelt to pray the night before he sailed That had not saved it from the queen’s men They had overturned the altars pulled down the statues and smashed the stained glass with warhammers Septon Barre could only curse them but Ser Hubard Rambton led his three sons to the sept to defend their gods The Rambtons had slain four of the queen’s men before the others overwhelmed them Afterward Guncer Sunglass mildest and most pious of lords told Stannis he could no longer support his claim Now he shared a sweltering cell with the septon and Ser Hubard’s two surviving sons The other lords had not been slow to take the lesson

The gods had never meant much to Davos the smuggler though like most men he had been known to make offerings to the Warrior before battle to the Smith when he launched a ship and to the Mother whenever his wife grew great with child He felt ill as he watched them burn and not only from the smoke

Maester Cressen would have stopped this The old man had challenged the Lord of Light and been struck down for his impiety or so the gossips told each other Davos knew the truth He had seen the maester slip something into the wine cup Poison What else could it be He drank a cup of death to free Stannis from Melisandre but somehow her god shielded her He would gladly have killed the red woman for that yet what chance would he have where a maester of the Citadel had failed He was only a smuggler raised high Davos of Flea Bottom the Onion Knight

The burning gods cast a pretty light wreathed in their robes of shifting flame red and orange and yellow Septon Barre had once told Davos how they’d been carved from the masts of the ships that had carried the first Targaryens from Valyria Over the centuries they had been painted and repainted gilded silvered jeweled Their beauty will make them more pleasing to R’hllor Melisandre said when she told Stannis to pull them down and drag them out the castle gates

The Maiden lay athwart the Warrior her arms widespread as if to embrace him The Mother seemed almost to shudder as the flames came licking up her face A longsword had been thrust through her heart and its leather grip was alive with flame The Father was on the bottom the first to fall Davos watched the hand of the Stranger writhe and curl as the fingers blackened and fell away one by one reduced to so much glowing charcoal Nearby Lord Celtigar coughed fitfully and covered his wrinkled face with a square of linen embroidered in red crabs The Myrmen swapped jokes as they enjoyed the warmth of the fire but young Lord Bar Emmon had turned a splotchy grey and Lord Velaryon was watching the king rather than the conflagration

Davos would have given much to know what he was thinking but one such as Velaryon would never confide in him The Lord of the Tides was of the blood of ancient Valyria and his House had thrice provided brides for Targaryen princes Davos Seaworth stank of fish and onions It was the same with the other lordlings He could trust none of them nor would they ever include him in their private councils They scorned his sons as well My grandsons will joust with theirs though and one day their blood may wed with mine In time my little black ship will fly as high as Velaryon’s seahorse or Celtigar’s red crabs

That is if Stannis won his throne If he lost   

Everything I am I owe to him Stannis had raised him to knighthood He had given him a place of honor at his table a war galley to sail in place of a smuggler’s skiff Dale and Allard captained galleys as well Maric was oarmaster on the Fury Matthos served his father on Black Betha and the king had taken Devan as a royal squire One day he would be knighted and the two little lads as well Marya was mistress of a small keep on Cape Wrath with servants who called her m’lady and Davos could hunt red deer in his own woods All this he had of Stannis Baratheon for the price of a few finger joints It was just what he did to me I had flouted the king’s laws all my life He has earned my loyalty Davos touched the little pouch that hung from the leather thong about his neck His fingers were his luck and he needed luck now As do we all Lord Stannis most of all

Pale flames licked at the grey sky Dark smoke rose twisting and curling When the wind pushed it toward them men blinked and wept and rubbed their eyes Allard turned his head away coughing and cursing A taste of things to come thought Davos Many and more would burn before this war was done

Melisandre was robed all in scarlet satin and blood velvet her eyes as red as the great ruby that glistened at her throat as if it too were afire In ancient books of Asshai it is written that there will come a day after a long summer when the stars bleed and the cold breath of darkness falls heavy on the world In this dread hour a warrior shall draw from the fire a burning sword And that sword shall be Lightbringer the Red Sword of Heroes and he who clasps it shall be Azor Ahai come again and the darkness shall flee before him She lifted her voice so it carried out over the gathered host Azor Ahai beloved of R’hllor The Warrior of Light the Son of Fire Come forth your sword awaits you Come forth and take it into your hand

Stannis Baratheon strode forward like a soldier marching into battle His squires stepped up to attend him Davos watched as his son Devan pulled a long padded glove over the king’s right hand The boy wore a cream-colored doublet with a fiery heart sewn on the breast Bryen Farring was similarly garbed as he tied a stiff leather cape around His Grace’s neck Behind Davos heard a faint clank and clatter of bells Under the sea smoke rises in bubbles and flames burn green and blue and black Patchface sang somewhere I know I know oh oh oh

The king plunged into the fire with his teeth clenched holding the leather cloak before him to keep off the flames He went straight to the Mother grasped the sword with his gloved hand and wrenched it free of the burning wood with a single hard jerk Then he was retreating the sword held high jade-green flames swirling around cherry-red steel Guards rushed to beat out the cinders that clung to the king’s clothing

A sword of fire shouted Queen Selyse Ser Axell Florent and the other queen’s men took up the cry A sword of fire It burns It burns A sword of fire

Melisandre lifted her hands above her head Behold A sign was promised and now a sign is seen Behold Lightbringer Azor Ahai has come again All hail the Warrior of Light All hail the Son of Fire

A ragged wave of shouts gave answer just as Stannis’s glove began to smolder Cursing the king thrust the point of the sword into the damp earth and beat out the flames against his leg

Lord cast your light upon us Melisandre called out

For the night is dark and full of terrors Selyse and her queen’s men replied Should I speak the words as well Davos wondered Do I owe Stannis that much Is this fiery god truly his own His shortened fingers twitched

Stannis peeled off the glove and let it fall to the ground The gods in the pyre were scarcely recognizable anymore The head fell off the Smith with a puff of ash and embers Melisandre sang in the tongue of Asshai her voice rising and falling like the tides of the sea Stannis untied his singed leather cape and listened in silence Thrust in the ground Lightbringer still glowed ruddy hot but the flames that clung to the sword were dwindling and dying
