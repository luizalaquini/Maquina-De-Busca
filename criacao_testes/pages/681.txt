1635 Wherefore O harlot hear the word of the LORD 1636 Thus saith
the Lord GOD Because thy filthiness was poured out and thy nakedness
discovered through thy whoredoms with thy lovers and with all the
idols of thy abominations and by the blood of thy children which
thou didst give unto them 1637 Behold therefore I will gather all
thy lovers with whom thou hast taken pleasure and all them that thou
hast loved with all them that thou hast hated I will even gather
them round about against thee and will discover thy nakedness unto
them that they may see all thy nakedness

1638 And I will judge thee as women that break wedlock and shed
blood are judged and I will give thee blood in fury and jealousy

1639 And I will also give thee into their hand and they shall throw
down thine eminent place and shall break down thy high places they
shall strip thee also of thy clothes and shall take thy fair jewels
and leave thee naked and bare

1640 They shall also bring up a company against thee and they shall
stone thee with stones and thrust thee through with their swords

1641 And they shall burn thine houses with fire and execute
judgments upon thee in the sight of many women and I will cause thee
to cease from playing the harlot and thou also shalt give no hire any
more

1642 So will I make my fury toward thee to rest and my jealousy
shall depart from thee and I will be quiet and will be no more
angry

1643 Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth but hast
fretted me in all these things behold therefore I also will
recompense thy way upon thine head saith the Lord GOD and thou shalt
not commit this lewdness above all thine abominations

1644 Behold every one that useth proverbs shall use this proverb
against thee saying As is the mother so is her daughter

1645 Thou art thy mothers daughter that lotheth her husband and her
children and thou art the sister of thy sisters which lothed their
husbands and their children your mother was an Hittite and your
father an Amorite

1646 And thine elder sister is Samaria she and her daughters that
dwell at thy left hand and thy younger sister that dwelleth at thy
right hand is Sodom and her daughters

1647 Yet hast thou not walked after their ways nor done after their
abominations but as if that were a very little thing thou wast
corrupted more than they in all thy ways

1648 As I live saith the Lord GOD Sodom thy sister hath not done
she nor her daughters as thou hast done thou and thy daughters

1649 Behold this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom pride
fulness of bread and abundance of idleness was in her and in her
daughters neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy

1650 And they were haughty and committed abomination before me
therefore I took them away as I saw good

1651 Neither hath Samaria committed half of thy sins but thou hast
multiplied thine abominations more than they and hast justified thy
sisters in all thine abominations which thou hast done

1652 Thou also which hast judged thy sisters bear thine own shame
for thy sins that thou hast committed more abominable than they they
are more righteous than thou yea be thou confounded also and bear
thy shame in that thou hast justified thy sisters

1653 When I shall bring again their captivity the captivity of Sodom
and her daughters and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters
then will I bring again the captivity of thy captives in the midst of
them 1654 That thou mayest bear thine own shame and mayest be
confounded in all that thou hast done in that thou art a comfort unto
them

1655 When thy sisters Sodom and her daughters shall return to their
former estate and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their
former estate then thou and thy daughters shall return to your former
estate

1656 For thy sister Sodom was not mentioned by thy mouth in the day
of thy pride 1657 Before thy wickedness was discovered as at the
time of thy reproach of the daughters of Syria and all that are round
about her the daughters of the Philistines which despise thee round
about

1658 Thou hast borne thy lewdness and thine abominations saith the
LORD

1659 For thus saith the Lord GOD I will even deal with thee as thou
hast done which hast despised the oath in breaking the covenant

1660 Nevertheless I will remember my covenant with thee in the days
of thy youth and I will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant

1661 Then thou shalt remember thy ways and be ashamed when thou
shalt receive thy sisters thine elder and thy younger and I will
