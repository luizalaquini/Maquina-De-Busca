Washing won’t do any good Sansa said Not if you scrubbed all day and all night The silk is ruined

Then I’ll… make you a new one Arya said

Sansa threw back her head in disdain You You couldn’t sew a dress fit to clean the pigsties

Their father sighed I did not call you here to talk of dresses I’m sending you both back to Winterfell

For the second time Sansa found herself too stunned for words She felt her eyes grow moist again

You can’t Arya said

Please Father Sansa managed at last Please don’t

Eddard Stark favored his daughters with a tired smile At last we’ve found something you agree on

I didn’t do anything wrong Sansa pleaded with him I don’t want to go back She loved Mng’s Landing the pagaentry of the court the high lords and ladies in their velvets and silks and gemstones the great city with all its people The tournament had been the most magical time of her whole life and there was so much she had not seen yet harvest feasts and masked balls and mummer shows She could not bear the thought of losing it all Send Arya away she started it Father I swear it I’ll be good you’ll see just let me stay and I promise to be as fine and noble and courteous as the queen

Father’s mouth twitched strangely Sansa I’m not sending you away for fighting though the gods know I’m sick of you two squabbling I want you back in Winterfell for your own safety Three of my men were cut down like dogs not a league from where we sit and what does Robert do He goes hunting

Arya was chewing at her lip in that disgusting way she had Can we take Syrio back with us

Who cares about your stupid dancing master Sansa flared Father I only just now remembered I can’t go away I’m to marry Prince Joffrey She tried to smile bravely for him I love him Father I truly truly do I love him as much as Queen Naerys loved Prince Aemon the Dragonknight as much as Jonquil loved Ser Florian I want to be his queen and have his babies

Sweet one her father said gently listen to me When you’re old enough I will make you a match with a high lord who’s worthy of you someone brave and gentle and strong This match with Joffrey was a terrible mistake That boy is no Prince Aemon you must believe me

He is Sansa insisted I don’t want someone brave and gentle I want him We’ll be ever so happy just like in the songs you’ll see I’ll give him a son with golden hair and one day he’ll be the king of all the realm the greatest king that ever was as brave as the wolf and as proud as the lion

Arya made a face Not if Joffrey’s his father she said He’s a liar and a craven and anyhow he’s a stag not a lion

Sansa felt tears in her eyes He is not He’s not the least bit like that old drunken king she screamed at her sister forgetting herself in her grief

Father looked at her strangely Gods he swore softly out of the mouth of babes… He shouted for Septa Mordane To the girls he said I am looking for a fast trading galley to take you home These days the sea is safer than the kingsroad You will sail as soon as I can find a proper ship with Septa Mordane and a complement of guards… and yes with Syrio Forel if he agrees to enter my service But say nothing of this It’s better if no one knows of our plans We’ll talk again tomorrow

Sansa cried as Septa Mordane marched them down the steps They were going to take it all away the tournaments and the court and her prince everything they were going to send her back to the bleak grey walls of Winterfell and lock her up forever Her life was over before it had begun

Stop that weeping child Septa Mordane said sternly I am certain your lord father knows what is best for you

It won’t be so bad Sansa Arya said We’re going to sail on a galley It will be an adventure and then we’ll be with Bran and Robb again and Old Nan and Hodor and the rest She touched her on the arm

Hodor Sansa yelled You ought to marry Hodor you’re just like him stupid and hairy and ugly She wrenched away from her sister’s hand stormed into her bedchamber and barred the door behind her





EDDARD

Pain is a gift from the gods Lord Eddard Grand Maester Pycelle told him It means the bone is knitting the flesh healing itself Be thankful

I will be thankful when my leg stops throbbing

Pycelle set a stoppered flask on the table by the bed The milk of the poppy for when the pain grows too onerous
