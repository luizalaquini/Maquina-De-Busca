Not to me Dany set great store by Ser Jorah’s counsel but to leave Meereen untouched was more than she could stomach She could not forget the children on their posts the birds tearing at their entrails their skinny arms pointing up the coast road Ser Jorah you say we have no food left If I march west how can I feed my freedmen

You can’t I am sorry Khaleesi They must feed themselves or starve Many and more will die along the march yes That will be hard but there is no way to save them We need to put this scorched earth well behind us

Dany had left a trail of corpses behind her when she crossed the red waste It was a sight she never meant to see again No she said I will not march my people off to die My children There must be some way into this city

I know a way Brown Ben Plumm stroked his speckled grey-and-white beard Sewers

Sewers What do you mean

Great brick sewers empty into the Skahazadhan carrying the city’s wastes They might be a way in for a few That was how I escaped Meereen after Scarb lost his head Brown Ben made a face The smell has never left me I dream of it some nights

Ser Jorah looked dubious Easier to go out than in it would seem to me These sewers empty into the river you say That would mean the mouths are right below the walls

And closed with iron grates Brown Ben admitted though some have rusted through else I would have drowned in shit Once inside it is a long foul climb in pitch-dark through a maze of brick where a man could lose himself forever The filth is never lower than waist high and can rise over your head from the stains I saw on the walls There’s things down there too Biggest rats you ever saw and worse things Nasty

Daario Naharis laughed As nasty as you when you came crawling out If any man were fool enough to try this every slaver in Meereen would smell them the moment they emerged

Brown Ben shrugged Her Grace asked if there was a way in so I told her… but Ben Plumm isn’t going down in them sewers again not for all the gold in the Seven Kingdoms If there’s others want to try it though they’re welcome

Aggo Jhogo and Grey Worm all tried to speak at once but Dany raised her hand for silence These sewers do not sound promising Grey Worm would lead his Unsullied down the sewers if she commanded it she knew her bloodriders would do no less But none of them was suited to the task The Dothraki were horsemen and the strength of the Unsullied was their discipline on the battlefield Can I send men to die in the dark on such a slender hope I must think on this some more Return to your duties

Her captains bowed and left her with her handmaids and her dragons But as Brown Ben was leaving Viserion spread his pale white wings and flapped lazily at his head One of the wings buffeted the sellsword in his face The white dragon landed awkwardly with one foot on the man’s head and one on his shoulder shrieked and flew off again He likes you Ben said Dany

And well he might Brown Ben laughed I have me a drop of the dragon blood myself you know

You Dany was startled Plumm was a creature of the free companies an amiable mongrel He had a broad brown face with a broken nose and a head of nappy grey hair and his Dothraki mother had bequeathed him large dark almond-shaped eyes He claimed to be part Braavosi part Summer Islander part Ibbenese part Qohorik part Dothraki part Dornish and part Westerosi but this was the first she had heard of Targaryen blood She gave him a searching look and said How could that be

Well said Brown Ben there was some old Plumm in the Sunset Kingdoms who wed a dragon princess My grandmama told me the tale He lived in King Aegon’s day

Which King Aegon Dany asked Five Aegons have ruled in Westeros Her brother’s son would have been the sixth but the Usurper’s men had dashed his head against a wall

Five were there Well that’s a confusion I could not give you a number my queen This old Plumm was a lord though must have been a famous fellow in his day the talk of all the land The thing was begging your royal pardon he had himself a cock six foot long

The three bells in Dany’s braid tinkled when she laughed You mean inches I think

Feet Brown Ben said firmly If it was inches who’d want to talk about it now Your Grace

Dany giggled like a little girl Did your grandmother claim she’d actually seen this prodigy

That the old crone never did She was half-Ibbenese and half-Qohorik never been to Westeros my grandfather must have told her Some Dothraki killed him before I was born

And where did your grandfather’s knowledge come from

One of them tales told at the teat I’d guess Brown Ben shrugged That’s all I know about Aegon the Unnumbered or old Lord Plumm’s mighty manhood I fear I best see to my Sons

Go do that Dany told him

When Brown Ben left she lay back on her cushions If you were grown she told Drogon scratching him between the horns I’d fly you over the walls and melt that harpy down to slag But it would be years before her dragons were large enough to ride And when they are who shall ride them The dragon has three heads but I have only one She thought of Daario If ever there was a man who could rape a woman with his eyes…

To be sure she was just as guilty Dany found herself stealing looks at the Tyroshi when her captains came to council and sometimes at night she remembered the way his gold tooth glittered when he smiled That and his eyes His bright blue eyes On the road from Yunkai Daario had brought her a flower or a sprig of some plant every evening when he made his report… to help her learn the land he said Waspwillow dusky roses wild mint lady’s lace daggerleaf broom prickly ben harpy’s gold… He tried to spare me the sight of the dead children too He should not have done that but he meant it kindly And Daario Naharis made her laugh which Ser Jorah never did

Dany tried to imagine what it would be like if she allowed Daario to kiss her the way Jorah had kissed her on the ship The thought was exciting and disturbing both at once It is too great a risk The Tyroshi sellsword was not a good man no one needed to tell her that Under the smiles and the jests he was dangerous even cruel Sallor and Prendahl had woken one morning as his partners that very night he’d given her their heads Khal Drogo could be cruel as well and there was never a man more dangerous She had come to love him all the same Could I love Daario What would it mean if I took him into my bed Would that make him one of the heads of the dragon Ser Jorah would be angry she knew but he was the one who’d said she had to take two husbands Perhaps I should marry them both and be done with it
