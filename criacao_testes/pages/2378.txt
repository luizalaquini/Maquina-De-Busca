She had last seen snow the day she’d left Winterfell That was a lighter fall than this she remembered Robb had melting flakes in his hair when he hugged me and the snowball Arya tried to make kept coming apart in her hands It hurt to remember how happy she had been that morning Hullen had helped her mount and she’d ridden out with the snowflakes swirling around her off to see the great wide world I thought my song was beginning that day but it was almost done

Sansa left the shutters open as she dressed It would be cold she knew though the Eyrie’s towers encircled the garden and protected it from the worst of the mountain winds She donned silken smallclothes and a linen shift and over that a warm dress of blue lambswool Two pairs of hose for her legs boots that laced up to her knees heavy leather gloves and finally a hooded cloak of soft white fox fur

Her maid rolled herself more tightly in her blanket as the snow began to drift in the window Sansa eased open the door and made her way down the winding stair When she opened the door to the garden it was so lovely that she held her breath unwilling to disturb such perfect beauty The snow drifted down and down all in ghostly silence and lay thick and unbroken on the ground All color had fled the world outside It was a place of whites and blacks and greys White towers and white snow and white statues black shadows and black trees the dark grey sky above A pure world Sansa thought I do not belong here

Yet she stepped out all the same Her boots tore ankle-deep holes into the smooth white surface of the snow yet made no sound Sansa drifted past frosted shrubs and thin dark trees and wondered if she were still dreaming Drifting snowflakes brushed her face as light as lover’s kisses and melted on her cheeks At the center of the garden beside the statue of the weeping woman that lay broken and half-buried on the ground she turned her face up to the sky and closed her eyes She could feel the snow on her lashes taste it on her lips It was the taste of Winterfell The taste of innocence The taste of dreams

When Sansa opened her eyes again she was on her knees She did not remember falling It seemed to her that the sky was a lighter shade of grey Dawn she thought Another day Another new day It was the old days she hungered for Prayed for But who could she pray to The garden had been meant for a godswood once she knew but the soil was too thin and stony for a weirwood to take root A godswood without gods as empty as me

She scooped up a handful of snow and squeezed it between her fingers Heavy and wet the snow packed easily Sansa began to make snowballs shaping and smoothing them until they were round and white and perfect She remembered a summer’s snow in Winterfell when Arya and Bran had ambushed her as she emerged from the keep one morning They’d each had a dozen snowballs to hand and she’d had none Bran had been perched on the roof of the covered bridge out of reach but Sansa had chased Arya through the stables and around the kitchen until both of them were breathless She might even have caught her but she’d slipped on some ice Her sister came back to see if she was hurt When she said she wasn’t Arya hit her in the face with another snowball but Sansa grabbed her leg and pulled her down and was rubbing snow in her hair when Jory came along and pulled them apart laughing

What do I want with snowballs She looked at her sad little arsenal There’s no one to throw them at She let the one she was making drop from her hand I could build a snow knight instead she thought Or even   

She pushed two of her snowballs together added a third packed more snow in around them and patted the whole thing into the shape of a cylinder When it was done she stood it on end and used the tip of her little finger to poke holes in it for windows The crenellations around the top took a little more care but when they were done she had a tower I need some walls now Sansa thought and then a keep She set to work

The snow fell and the castle rose Two walls ankle-high the inner taller than the outer Towers and turrets keeps and stairs a round kitchen a square armory the stables along the inside of the west wall It was only a castle when she began but before very long Sansa knew it was Winterfell She found twigs and fallen branches beneath the snow and broke off the ends to make the trees for the godswood For the gravestones in the lichyard she used bits of bark Soon her gloves and her boots were crusty white her hands were tingling and her feet were soaked and cold but she did not care The castle was all that mattered Some things were hard to remember but most came back to her easily as if she had been there only yesterday The Library Tower with the steep stonework stair twisting about its exterior The gatehouse two huge bulwarks the arched gate between them crenellations all along the top   

And all the while the snow kept falling piling up in drifts around her buildings as fast as she raised them She was patting down the pitched roof of the Great Hall when she heard a voice and looked up to see her maid calling from her window Was my lady well Did she wish to break her fast Sansa shook her head and went back to shaping snow adding a chimney to one end of the Great Hall where the hearth would stand inside

Dawn stole into her garden like a thief The grey of the sky grew lighter still and the trees and shrubs turned a dark green beneath their stoles of snow A few servants came out and watched her for a time but she paid them no mind and they soon went back inside where it was warmer Sansa saw Lady Lysa gazing down from her balcony wrapped up in a blue velvet robe trimmed with fox fur but when she looked again her aunt was gone Maester Colemon popped out of the rookery and peered down for a while skinny and shivering but curious

Her bridges kept falling down There was a covered bridge between the armory and the main keep and another that went from the fourth floor of the bell tower to the second floor of the rookery but no matter how carefully she shaped them they would not hold together The third time one collapsed on her she cursed aloud and sat back in helpless frustration

Pack the snow around a stick Sansa

She did not know how long he had been watching her or when he had returned from the Vale A stick she asked

That will give it strength enough to stand I’d think Petyr said May I come into your castle my lady

Sansa was wary Don’t break it Be   

   gentle He smiled Winterfell has withstood fiercer enemies than me It is Winterfell is it not

Yes Sansa admitted

He walked along outside the walls I used to dream of it in those years after Cat went north with Eddard Stark In my dreams it was ever a dark place and cold

No It was always warm even when it snowed Water from the hot springs is piped through the walls to warm them and inside the glass gardens it was always like the hottest day of summer She stood towering over the great white castle I can’t think how to do the glass roof over the gardens

Littlefinger stroked his chin where his beard had been before Lysa had asked him to shave it off The glass was locked in frames no Twigs are your answer Peel them and cross them and use bark to tie them together into frames I’ll show you He moved through the garden gathering up twigs and sticks and shaking the snow from them When he had enough he stepped over both walls with a single long stride and squatted on his heels in the middle of the yard Sansa came closer to watch what he was doing His hands were deft and sure and before long he had a crisscrossing latticework of twigs very like the one that roofed the glass gardens of Winterfell We will need to imagine the glass to be sure he said when he gave it to her

This is just right she said

He touched her face And so is that

Sansa did not understand And so is what

Your smile my lady Shall I make another for you

If you would

Nothing could please me more

She raised the walls of the glass gardens while Littlefinger roofed them over and when they were done with that he helped her extend the walls and build the guardshall When she used sticks for the covered bridges they stood just as he had said they would The First Keep was simple enough an old round drum tower but Sansa was stymied again when it came to putting the gargoyles around the top Again he had the answer It’s been snowing on your castle my lady he pointed out What do the gargoyles look like when they’re covered with snow

Sansa closed her eyes to see them in memory They’re just white lumps

Well then Gargoyles are hard but white lumps should be easy And they were

The Broken Tower was easier still They made a tall tower together kneeling side by side to roll it smooth and when they’d raised it Sansa stuck her fingers through the top grabbed a handful of snow and flung it full in his face Petyr yelped as the snow slid down under his collar That was unchivalrously done my lady

As was bringing me here when you swore to take me home

She wondered where this courage had come from to speak to him so frankly From Winterfell she thought I am stronger within the walls of Winterfell

His face grew serious Yes I played you false in that    and in one other thing as well

Sansa’s stomach was aflutter What other thing

I told you that nothing could please me more than to help you with your castle I fear that was a lie as well Something else would please me more He stepped closer This

Sansa tried to step back but he pulled her into his arms and suddenly he was kissing her Feebly she tried to squirm but only succeeded in pressing herself more tightly against him His mouth was on hers swallowing her words He tasted of mint For half a heartbeat she yielded to his kiss    before she turned her face away and wrenched free What are you doing

Petyr straightened his cloak Kissing a snow maid

You’re supposed to kiss her Sansa glanced up at Lysa’s balcony but it was empty now Your lady wife

I do Lysa has no cause for complaint He smiled I wish you could see yourself my lady You are so beautiful You’re crusted over with snow like some little bear cub but your face is flushed and you can scarcely breathe How long have you been out here You must be very cold Let me warm you Sansa Take off those gloves give me your hands

I won’t He sounded almost like Marillion the night he’d gotten so drunk at the wedding Only this time Lothor Brune would not appear to save her Ser Lothor was Petyr’s man You shouldn’t kiss me I might have been your own daughter   

Might have been he admitted with a rueful smile But you’re not are you You are Eddard Stark’s daughter and Cat’s But I think you might be even more beautiful than your mother was when she was your age

Petyr please Her voice sounded so weak Please   

A castle

The voice was loud shrill and childish Littlefinger turned away from her Lord Robert He sketched a bow Should you be out in the snow without your gloves

Did you make the snow castle Lord Littlefinger

Alayne did most of it my lord

Sansa said It’s meant to be Winterfell

Winterfell Robert was small for eight a stick of a boy with splotchy skin and eyes that were always runny Under one arm he clutched the threadbare cloth doll he carried everywhere

Winterfell is the seat of House Stark Sansa told her husband-to-be The great castle of the north
