82 And he said unto them What have I done now in comparison of you
Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage
of Abiezer  83 God hath delivered into your hands the princes of
Midian Oreb and Zeeb and what was I able to do in comparison of you
Then their anger was abated toward him when he had said that

84 And Gideon came to Jordan and passed over he and the three
hundred men that were with him faint yet pursuing them

85 And he said unto the men of Succoth Give I pray you loaves of
bread unto the people that follow me for they be faint and I am
pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna kings of Midian

86 And the princes of Succoth said Are the hands of Zebah and
Zalmunna now in thine hand that we should give bread unto thine army
87 And Gideon said Therefore when the LORD hath delivered Zebah and
Zalmunna into mine hand then I will tear your flesh with the thorns
of the wilderness and with briers

88 And he went up thence to Penuel and spake unto them likewise and
the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered him

89 And he spake also unto the men of Penuel saying When I come
again in peace I will break down this tower

810 Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor and their hosts with them
about fifteen thousand men all that were left of all the hosts of the
children of the east for there fell an hundred and twenty thousand
men that drew sword

811 And Gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on the
east of Nobah and Jogbehah and smote the host for the host was
secure

812 And when Zebah and Zalmunna fled he pursued after them and took
the two kings of Midian Zebah and Zalmunna and discomfited all the
host

813 And Gideon the son of Joash returned from battle before the sun
was up 814 And caught a young man of the men of Succoth and
enquired of him and he described unto him the princes of Succoth and
the elders thereof even threescore and seventeen men

815 And he came unto the men of Succoth and said Behold Zebah and
Zalmunna with whom ye did upbraid me saying Are the hands of Zebah
and Zalmunna now in thine hand that we should give bread unto thy men
that are weary  816 And he took the elders of the city and thorns
of the wilderness and briers and with them he taught the men of
Succoth

817 And he beat down the tower of Penuel and slew the men of the
city

818 Then said he unto Zebah and Zalmunna What manner of men were
they whom ye slew at Tabor And they answered As thou art so were
they each one resembled the children of a king

819 And he said They were my brethren even the sons of my mother
as the LORD liveth if ye had saved them alive I would not slay you

820 And he said unto Jether his firstborn Up and slay them But the
youth drew not his sword for he feared because he was yet a youth

821 Then Zebah and Zalmunna said Rise thou and fall upon us for as
the man is so is his strength And Gideon arose and slew Zebah and
Zalmunna and took away the ornaments that were on their camels
necks

822 Then the men of Israel said unto Gideon Rule thou over us both
thou and thy son and thy sons son also for thou hast delivered us
from the hand of Midian

823 And Gideon said unto them I will not rule over you neither
shall my son rule over you the LORD shall rule over you

824 And Gideon said unto them I would desire a request of you that
ye would give me every man the earrings of his prey For they had
golden earrings because they were Ishmaelites  825 And they
answered We will willingly give them And they spread a garment and
did cast therein every man the earrings of his prey

826 And the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was a
thousand and seven hundred shekels of gold beside ornaments and
collars and purple raiment that was on the kings of Midian and
beside the chains that were about their camels necks

827 And Gideon made an ephod thereof and put it in his city even in
Ophrah and all Israel went thither a whoring after it which thing
became a snare unto Gideon and to his house

828 Thus was Midian subdued before the children of Israel so that
they lifted up their heads no more And the country was in quietness
forty years in the days of Gideon

829 And Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelt in his own house

830 And Gideon had threescore and ten sons of his body begotten for
he had many wives
