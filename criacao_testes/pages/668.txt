Tom ran his fingers down his strings Then let’s hear it pie boy He threw back his head and sang A bear there was a bear a bear All black and brown and covered with hair…

Hot Pie joined in lustily even bouncing in his saddle a little on the rhymes Arya stared at him in astonishment He had a good voice and he sang well He never did anything well except bake she thought to herself

A small brook flowed into the Trident a little farther on As they waded across their singing flushed a duck from among the reeds Anguy stopped where he stood unslung his bow notched an arrow and brought it down The bird fell in the shallows not far from the bank Lem took off his yellow cloak and waded in knee-deep to retrieve it complaining all the while Do you think Sharna might have lemons down in that cellar of hers said Anguy to Tom as they watched Lem splash around cursing A Dornish girl once cooked me duck with lemons He sounded wistful

Tom and Hot Pie resumed their song on the other side of the brook with the duck hanging from Lem’s belt beneath his yellow cloak Somehow the singing made the miles seem shorter It was not very long at all until the inn appeared before them rising from the riverbank where the Trident made a great bend to the north Arya squinted at it suspiciously as they neared It did not look like an outlaws’ lair she had to admit it looked friendly even homey with its whitewashed upper story and slate roof and the smoke curling up lazy from its chimney Stables and other outbuildings surrounded it and there was an arbor in back and apple trees a small garden The inn even had its own dock thrusting out into the river and…

Gendry she called her voice low and urgent They have a boat We could sail the rest of the way up to Riverrun It would be faster than riding I think

He looked dubious Did you ever sail a boat

You put up the sail she said and the wind pushes it

What if the wind is blowing the wrong way

Then there’s oars to row

Against the current Gendry frowned Wouldn’t that be slow And what if the boat tips over and we fall into the water It’s not our boat anyway it’s the inn’s

We could take it Arya chewed her lip and said nothing They dismounted in front of stables There were no other horses to be seen but Arya noticed fresh manure in many of the stalls One of us should watch the horses she said wary

Tom overheard her There’s no need for that Squab Come eat they’ll be safe enough

I’ll stay Gendry said ignoring the singer You can come get me after you’ve had some food

Nodding Arya set off after Hot Pie and Lem Her sword was still in its sheath across her back and she kept a hand close to the hilt of the dagger she had stolen from Roose Bolton in case she didn’t like whatever they found within

The painted sign above the door showed a picture of some old king on his knees Inside was the common room where a very tall ugly woman with a knobby chin stood with her hands on her hips glaring Don’t just stand there boy she snapped Or are you a girl Either one you’re blocking my door Get in or get out Lem what did I tell you about my floor You’re all mud

We shot a duck Lem held it out like a peace banner

The woman snatched it from his hand Anguy shot a duck is what you’re meaning Get your boots off are you deaf or just stupid She turned away Husband she called loudly Get up here the lads are back Husband

Up the cellar steps came a man in a stained apron grumbling He was a head shorter than the woman with a lumpy face and loose yellowish skin that still showed the marks of some pox I’m here woman quit your bellowing What is it now

Hang this she said handing him the duck

Anguy shuffled his feet We were thinking we might eat it Sharna With lemons If you had some

Lemons And where would we get lemons Does this look like Dorne to you you freckled fool Why don’t you hop out back to the lemon trees and pick us a bushel and some nice olives and pomegranates too She shook a finger at him Now I suppose I could cook it with Lem’s cloak if you like but not till it’s hung for a few days You’ll eat rabbit or you won’t eat Roast rabbit on a spit would be quickest if you’ve got a hunger Or might be you’d like it stewed with ale and onions

Arya could almost taste the rabbit We have no coin but we brought some carrots and cabbages we could trade you

Did you now And where would they be

Hot Pie give her the cabbages Arya said and he did though he approached the old woman as gingerly as if she were Rorge or Biter or Vargo Hoat

The woman gave the vegetables a close inspection and the boy a closer one Where is this hot pie

Here Me It’s my name And she’s… ah… Squab

Not under my roof I give my diners and my dishes different names so as to tell them apart Husband
