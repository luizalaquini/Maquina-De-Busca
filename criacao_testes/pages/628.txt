Perhaps it was only wind blowing against the rock or the sound of the sea on the shore but for an instant Davos Seaworth heard her answer You called the fire she whispered her voice as faint as the sound of waves in a seashell sad and soft You burned us… burned us… burrrned usssssss

It was her Davos cried Mother don’t forsake us It was her who burned you the red woman Melisandre her He could see her the heart-shaped face the red eyes the long coppery hair her red gowns moving like flames as she walked a swirl of silk and satin She had come from Asshai in the east she had come to Dragonstone and won Selyse and her queen’s men for her alien god and then the king Stannis Baratheon himself He had gone so far as to put the fiery heart on his banners the fiery heart of R’hllor Lord of Light and God of Flame and Shadow At Melisandre’s urging he had dragged the Seven from their sept at Dragonstone and burned them before the castle gates and later he had burned the godswood at Storm’s End as well even the heart tree a huge white weirwood with a solemn face

It was her work Davos said again more weakly Her work and yours onion knight You rowed her into Storm’s End in the black of night so she might loose her shadow child You are not guiltless no You rode beneath her banner and flew it from your mast You watched the Seven burn at Dragonstone and did nothing She gave the Father’s justice to the fire and the Mother’s mercy and the wisdom of the Crone Smith and Stranger Maid and Warrior she burnt them all to the glory of her cruel god and you stood and held your tongue Even when she killed old Maester Cressen even then you did nothing

The sail was a hundred yards away and moving fast across the bay In a few more moments it would be past him and dwindling

Ser Davos Seaworth began to climb his rock

He pulled himself up with trembling hands his head swimming with fever Twice his maimed fingers slipped on the damp stone and he almost fell but somehow he managed to cling to his perch If he fell he was dead and he had to live For a little while more at least There was something he had to do

The top of the rock was too small to stand on safely as weak as he was so he crouched and waved his fleshless arms Ship he screamed into the wind Ship here here From up here he could see her more clearly the lean striped hull the bronze figurehead the billowing sail There was a name painted on her hull but Davos had never learned to read Ship he called again help me HELP ME

A crewman on her forecastle saw him and pointed He watched as other sailors moved to the gunwale to gape at him A short while later the galley’s sail came down her oars slid out and she swept around toward his refuge She was too big to approach the rock closely but thirty yards away she launched a small boat Davos clung to his rock and watched it creep toward him Four men were rowing while a fifth sat in the prow You the fifth man called out when they were only a few feet from his island you up on the rock Who are you

A smuggler who rose above himself thought Davos a fool who loved his king too much and forgot his gods His throat was parched and he had forgotten how to talk The words felt strange on his tongue and sounded stranger in his ears I was in the battle I was… a captain a… a knight I was a knight

Aye ser the man said and serving which king

The galley might be Joffrey’s he realized suddenly If he spoke the wrong name now she would abandon him to his fate But no her hull was striped She was Lysene she was Salladhor Saan’s The Mother sent her here the Mother in her mercy She had a task for him Stannis lives he knew then I have a king still And sons I have other sons and a wife loyal and loving How could he have forgotten The Mother was merciful indeed

Stannis he shouted back at the Lyseni Gods be good I serve King Stannis

Aye said the man in the boat and so do we





Sansa


The invitation seemed innocent enough but every time Sansa read it her tummy tightened into a knot She’s to be queen now she’s beautiful and rich and everyone loves her why would she want to sup with a traitor’s daughter It could be curiosity she supposed perhaps Margaery Tyrell wanted to get the measure of the rival she’d displaced Does she resent me I wonder Does she think I bear her ill will…

Sansa had watched from the castle walls as Margaery Tyrell and her escort made their way up Aegon’s High Hill Joffrey had met his new bride-to-be at the King’s Gate to welcome her to the city and they rode side by side through cheering crowds Joff glittering in gilded armor and the Tyrell girl splendid in green with a cloak of autumn flowers blowing from her shoulders She was sixteen brown-haired and brown-eyed slender and beautiful The people called out her name as she passed held up their children for her blessing and scattered flowers under the hooves of her horse Her mother and grandmother followed close behind riding in a tall wheelhouse whose sides were carved into the shape of a hundred twining roses every one gilded and shining The smallfolk cheered them as well

The same smallfolk who pulled me from my horse and would have killed me if not for the Hound Sansa had done nothing to make the commons hate her no more than Margaery Tyrell had done to win their love Does she want me to love her too She studied the invitation which looked to be written in Margaery’s own hand Does she want my blessing Sansa wondered if Joffrey knew of this supper For all she knew it might be his doing That thought made her fearful If Joff was behind the invitation he would have some cruel jape planned to shame her in the older girl’s eyes Would he command his Kingsguard to strip her naked once again The last time he had done that his uncle Tyrion had stopped him but the Imp could not save her now

No one can save me but my Florian Ser Dontos had promised he would help her escape but not until the night of Joffrey’s wedding The plans had been well laid her dear devoted knight-turned-fool assured her there was nothing to do until then but endure and count the days

And sup with my replacement…

Perhaps she was doing Margaery Tyrell an injustice Perhaps the invitation was no more than a simple kindness an act of courtesy It might be just a supper But this was the Red Keep this was King’s Landing this was the court of King Joffrey Baratheon the First of His Name and if there was one thing that Sansa Stark had learned here it was mistrust

Even so she must accept She was nothing now the discarded daughter of a traitor and disgraced sister of a rebel lord She could scarcely refuse Joffrey’s queen-to-be

I wish the Hound were here The night of the battle Sandor Clegane had come to her chambers to take her from the city but Sansa had refused Sometimes she lay awake at night wondering if she’d been wise She had his stained white cloak hidden in a cedar chest beneath her summer silks She could not say why she’d kept it The Hound had turned craven she heard it said at the height of the battle he got so drunk the Imp had to take his men But Sansa understood She knew the secret of his burned face It was only the fire he feared That night the wildfire had set the river itself ablaze and filled the very air with green flame Even in the castle Sansa had been afraid Outside… she could scarcely imagine it

Sighing she got out quill and ink and wrote Margaery Tyrell a gracious note of acceptance

When the appointed night arrived another of the Kingsguard came for her a man as different from Sandor Clegane as… well as a flower from a dog The sight of Ser Loras Tyrell standing on her threshold made Sansa’s heart beat a little faster This was the first time she had been so close to him since he had returned to King’s Landing leading the vanguard of his father’s host For a moment she did not know what to say Ser Loras she finally managed you… you look so lovely

He gave her a puzzled smile My lady is too kind And beautiful besides My sister awaits you eagerly
