is of the children of the captivity of Judah regardeth not thee O
king nor the decree that thou hast signed but maketh his petition
three times a day

614 Then the king when he heard these words was sore displeased
with himself and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him and he
laboured till the going down of the sun to deliver him

615 Then these men assembled unto the king and said unto the king
Know O king that the law of the Medes and Persians is That no
decree nor statute which the king establisheth may be changed

616 Then the king commanded and they brought Daniel and cast him
into the den of lions Now the king spake and said unto Daniel Thy
God whom thou servest continually he will deliver thee

617 And a stone was brought and laid upon the mouth of the den and
the king sealed it with his own signet and with the signet of his
lords that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel

618 Then the king went to his palace and passed the night fasting
neither were instruments of musick brought before him and his sleep
went from him

619 Then the king arose very early in the morning and went in haste
unto the den of lions

620 And when he came to the den he cried with a lamentable voice
unto Daniel and the king spake and said to Daniel O Daniel servant
of the living God is thy God whom thou servest continually able to
deliver thee from the lions  621 Then said Daniel unto the king O
king live for ever

622 My God hath sent his angel and hath shut the lions mouths that
they have not hurt me forasmuch as before him innocency was found in
me and also before thee O king have I done no hurt

623 Then was the king exceedingly glad for him and commanded that
they should take Daniel up out of the den So Daniel was taken up out
of the den and no manner of hurt was found upon him because he
believed in his God

624 And the king commanded and they brought those men which had
accused Daniel and they cast them into the den of lions them their
children and their wives and the lions had the mastery of them and
brake all their bones in pieces or ever they came at the bottom of the
den

625 Then king Darius wrote unto all people nations and languages
that dwell in all the earth Peace be multiplied unto you

626 I make a decree That in every dominion of my kingdom men tremble
and fear before the God of Daniel for he is the living God and
stedfast for ever and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed
and his dominion shall be even unto the end

627 He delivereth and rescueth and he worketh signs and wonders in
heaven and in earth who hath delivered Daniel from the power of the
lions

628 So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius and in the reign
of Cyrus the Persian

71 In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream
and visions of his head upon his bed then he wrote the dream and
told the sum of the matters

72 Daniel spake and said I saw in my vision by night and behold
the four winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea

73 And four great beasts came up from the sea diverse one from
another

74 The first was like a lion and had eagles wings I beheld till
the wings thereof were plucked and it was lifted up from the earth
and made stand upon the feet as a man and a mans heart was given to
it

75 And behold another beast a second like to a bear and it raised
up itself on one side and it had three ribs in the mouth of it
between the teeth of it and they said thus unto it Arise devour
much flesh

76 After this I beheld and lo another like a leopard which had
upon the back of it four wings of a fowl the beast had also four
heads and dominion was given to it

77 After this I saw in the night visions and behold a fourth beast
dreadful and terrible and strong exceedingly and it had great iron
teeth it devoured and brake in pieces and stamped the residue with
the feet of it and it was diverse from all the beasts that were
before it and it had ten horns

78 I considered the horns and behold there came up among them
another little horn before whom there were three of the first horns
plucked up by the roots and behold in this horn were eyes like the
eyes of man and a mouth speaking great things

79 I beheld till the thrones were cast down and the Ancient of days
did sit whose garment was white as snow and the hair of his head
