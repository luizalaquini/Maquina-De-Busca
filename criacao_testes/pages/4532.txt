DAENERYS

In this city of splendors Dany had expected the House of the Undying Ones to be the most splendid of all but she emerged from her palanquin to behold a grey and ancient ruin

Long and low without towers or windows it coiled like a stone serpent through a grove of black-barked trees whose inky blue leaves made the stuff of the sorcerous drink the Qartheen called shade of the evening No other buildings stood near Black tiles covered the palace roof many fallen or broken the mortar between the stones was dry and crumbling She understood now why Xaro Xhoan Daxos called it the Palace of Dust Even Drogon seemed disquieted by the sight of it The black dragon hissed smoke seeping out between his sharp teeth

Blood of my blood Jhogo said in Dothraki this is an evil place a haunt of ghosts and maegi See how it drinks the morning sun Let us go before it drinks us as well

Ser Jorah Mormont came up beside them What power can they have if they live in that

Heed the wisdom of those who love you best said Xaro Xhoan Daxos lounging inside the palanquin Warlocks are bitter creatures who eat dust and drink of shadows They will give you naught They have naught to give

Aggo put a hand on his arakh Khaleesi it is said that many go into the Palace of Dust but few come out

It is said Jhogo agreed

We are blood of your blood said Aggo sworn to live and die as you do Let us walk with you in this dark place to keep you safe from harm

Some places even a khal must walk alone Dany said

Take me then Ser Jorah urged The risk—

Queen Daenerys must enter alone or not at all The warlock Pyat Pree stepped out from under the trees Has he been there all along Dany wondered Should she turn away now the doors of wisdom shall be closed to her forevermore

My pleasure barge awaits even now Xaro Xhoan Daxos called out Turn away from this folly most stubborn of queens I have flutists who will soothe your troubled soul with sweet music and a small girl whose tongue will make you sigh and melt

Ser Jorah Mormont gave the merchant prince a sour look Your Grace remember Mirri Maz Duur

I do Dany said suddenly decided I remember that she had knowledge And she was only a maegi

Pyat Pree smiled thinly The child speaks as sagely as a crone Take my arm and let me lead you

I am no child Dany took his arm nonetheless

It was darker than she would have thought under the black trees and the way was longer Though the path seemed to run straight from the street to the door of the palace Pyat Pree soon turned aside When she questioned him the warlock said only The front way leads in but never out again Heed my words my queen The House of the Undying Ones was not made for mortal men If you value your soul take care and do just as I tell you

I will do as you say Dany promised

When you enter you will find yourself in a room with four doors the one you have come through and three others Take the door to your right Each time the door to your right If you should come upon a stairwell climb Never go down and never take any door but the first door to your right

The door to my right Dany repeated I understand And when I leave the opposite

By no means Pyat Pree said Leaving and coming it is the same Always up Always the door to your right Other doors may open to you Within you will see many things that disturb you Visions of loveliness and visions of horror wonders and terrors Sights and sounds of days gone by and days to come and days that never were Dwellers and servitors may speak to you as you go Answer or ignore them as you choose but enter no room until you reach the audience chamber

I understand

When you come to the chamber of the Undying be patient Our little lives are no more than a flicker of a moth’s wing to them Listen well and write each word upon your heart

When they reached the door—a tall oval mouth set in a wall fashioned in the likeness of a human face—the smallest dwarf Dany had ever seen was waiting on the threshold He stood no higher than her knee his faced pinched and pointed snoutish but he was dressed in delicate livery of purple and blue and his tiny pink hands held a silver tray Upon it rested a slender crystal glass filled with a thick blue liquid shade of the evening the wine of warlocks Take and drink urged Pyat Pree

Will it turn my lips blue

One flute will serve only to unstop your ears and dissolve the caul from off your eyes so that you may hear and see the truths that will be laid before you

Dany raised the glass to her lips The first sip tasted like ink and spoiled meat foul but when she swallowed it seemed to come to life within her She could feel tendrils spreading through her chest like fingers of fire coiling around her heart and on her tongue was a taste like honey and anise and cream like mother’s milk and Drogo’s seed like red meat and hot blood and molten gold It was all the tastes she had ever known and none of them    and then the glass was empty

Now you may enter said the warlock Dany put the glass back on the servitor’s tray and went inside

She found herself in a stone anteroom with four doors one on each wall With never a hesitation she went to the door on her right and stepped through The second room was a twin to the first Again she turned to the right-hand door When she pushed it open she faced yet another small antechamber with four doors I am in the presence of sorcery

The fourth room was oval rather than square and walled in worm-eaten wood in place of stone Six passages led out from it in place of four Dany chose the rightmost and entered a long dim high-ceilinged hall Along the right hand was a row of torches burning with a smoky orange light but the only doors were to her left Drogon unfolded wide black wings and beat the stale air He flew twenty feet before thudding to an undignified crash Dany strode after him

The mold-eaten carpet under her feet had once been gorgeously colored and whorls of gold could still be seen in the fabric glinting broken amidst the faded grey and mottled green What remained served to muffle her footfalls but that was not all to the good Dany could hear sounds within the walls a faint scurrying and scrabbling that made her think of rats Drogon heard them too His head moved as he followed the sounds and when they stopped he gave an angry scream Other sounds even more disturbing came through some of the closed doors One shook and thumped as if someone were trying to break through From another came a dissonant piping that made the dragon lash his tail wildly from side to side Dany hurried quickly past

Not all the doors were closed I will not look Dany told herself but the temptation was too strong

In one room a beautiful woman sprawled naked on the floor while four little men crawled over her They had rattish pointed faces and tiny pink hands like the servitor who had brought her the glass of shade One was pumping between her thighs Another savaged her breasts worrying at the nipples with his wet red mouth tearing and chewing

Farther on she came upon a feast of corpses Savagely slaughtered the feasters lay strewn across overturned chairs and hacked trestle tables asprawl in pools of congealing blood Some had lost limbs even heads Severed hands clutched bloody cups wooden spoons roast fowl heels of bread In a throne above them sat a dead man with the head of a wolf He wore an iron crown and held a leg of lamb in one hand as a king might hold a scepter and his eyes followed Dany with mute appeal

She fled from him but only as far as the next open door I know this room she thought She remembered those great wooden beams and the carved animal faces that adorned them And there outside the window a lemon tree The sight of it made her heart ache with longing It is the house with the red door the house in Braavos No sooner had she thought it than old Ser Willem came into the room leaning heavily on his stick Little princess there you are he said in his gruff kind voice Come he said come to me my lady you’re home now you’re safe now His big wrinkled hand reached for her soft as old leather and Dany wanted to take it and hold it and kiss it she wanted that as much as she had ever wanted anything Her foot edged forward and then she thought He’s dead he’s dead the sweet old bear he died a long time ago She backed away and ran

The long hall went on and on and on with endless doors to her left and only torches to her right She ran past more doors than she could count closed doors and open ones doors of wood and doors of iron carved doors and plain ones doors with pulls and doors with locks and doors with knockers Drogon lashed against her back urging her on and Dany ran until she could run no more

Finally a great pair of bronze doors appeared to her left grander than the rest They swung open as she neared and she had to stop and look Beyond loomed a cavernous stone hall the largest she had ever seen The skulls of dead dragons looked down from its walls Upon a towering barbed throne sat an old man in rich robes an old man with dark eyes and long silver-grey hair Let him be king over charred bones and cooked meat he said to a man below him Let him be the king of ashes Drogon shrieked his claws digging through silk and skin but the king on his throne never heard and Dany moved on

Viserys was her first thought the next time she paused but a second glance told her otherwise The man had her brother’s hair but he was taller and his eyes were a dark indigo rather than lilac Aegon he said to a woman nursing a newborn babe in a great wooden bed What better name for a king

Will you make a song for him the woman asked

He has a song the man replied He is the prince that was promised and his is the song of ice and fire He looked up when he said it and his eyes met Dany’s and it seemed as if he saw her standing there beyond the door There must be one more he said though whether he was speaking to her or the woman in the bed she could not say The dragon has three heads He went to the window seat picked up a harp and ran his fingers lightly over its silvery strings Sweet sadness filled the room as man and wife and babe faded like the morning mist only the music lingering behind to speed her on her way

It seemed as though she walked for another hour before the long hall finally ended in a steep stone stair descending into darkness Every door open or closed had been to her left Dany looked back behind her The torches were going out she realized with a start of fear Perhaps twenty still burned Thirty at most One more guttered out even as she watched and the darkness came a little farther down the hall creeping toward her And as she listened it seemed as if she heard something else coming shuffling and dragging itself slowly along the faded carpet Terror filled her She could not go back and she was afraid to stay here but how could she go on There was no door on her right and the steps went down not up

Yet another torch went out as she stood pondering and the sounds grew faintly louder Drogon’s long neck snaked out and he opened his mouth to scream steam rising from between his teeth He hears it too Dany turned to the blank wall once more but there was nothing Could there be a secret door a door I cannot see Another torch went out Another The first door on the right he said always the first door on the right The first door on the right   

It came to her suddenly    is the last door on the left

She flung herself through Beyond was another small room with four doors To the right she went and to the right and to the right and to the right and to the right and to the right and to the right until she was dizzy and out of breath once more

When she stopped she found herself in yet another dank stone chamber    but this time the door opposite was round shaped like an open mouth and Pyat Pree stood outside in the grass beneath the trees Can it be that the Undying are done with you so soon he asked in disbelief when he saw her

So soon she said confused I’ve walked for hours and still not found them

You have taken a wrong turning Come I will lead you Pyat Pree held out his hand

Dany hesitated There was a door to her right still closed   

That’s not the way Pyat Pree said firmly his blue lips prim with disapproval The Undying Ones will not wait forever
