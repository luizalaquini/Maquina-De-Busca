multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion
over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every
living thing that moveth upon the earth

129 And God said Behold I have given you every herb bearing seed
which is upon the face of all the earth and every tree in the which
is the fruit of a tree yielding seed to you it shall be for meat

130 And to every beast of the earth and to every fowl of the air
and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth wherein there is
life I have given every green herb for meat and it was so

131 And God saw every thing that he had made and behold it was
very good And the evening and the morning were the sixth day

21 Thus the heavens and the earth were finished and all the host of
them

22 And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made and
he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made

23 And God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it because that
in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made

24 These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when
they were created in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the
heavens 25 And every plant of the field before it was in the earth
and every herb of the field before it grew for the LORD God had not
caused it to rain upon the earth and there was not a man to till the
ground

26 But there went up a mist from the earth and watered the whole
face of the ground

27 And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground and
breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living
soul

28 And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden and there he
put the man whom he had formed

29 And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is
pleasant to the sight and good for food the tree of life also in the
midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of good and evil

210 And a river went out of Eden to water the garden and from thence
it was parted and became into four heads

211 The name of the first is Pison that is it which compasseth the
whole land of Havilah where there is gold 212 And the gold of that
land is good there is bdellium and the onyx stone

213 And the name of the second river is Gihon the same is it that
compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia

214 And the name of the third river is Hiddekel that is it which
goeth toward the east of Assyria And the fourth river is Euphrates

215 And the LORD God took the man and put him into the garden of
Eden to dress it and to keep it

216 And the LORD God commanded the man saying Of every tree of the
garden thou mayest freely eat 217 But of the tree of the knowledge
of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou
eatest thereof thou shalt surely die

218 And the LORD God said It is not good that the man should be
alone I will make him an help meet for him

219 And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the
field and every fowl of the air and brought them unto Adam to see
what he would call them and whatsoever Adam called every living
creature that was the name thereof

220 And Adam gave names to all cattle and to the fowl of the air
and to every beast of the field but for Adam there was not found an
help meet for him

221 And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he
slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead
thereof 222 And the rib which the LORD God had taken from man made
he a woman and brought her unto the man

223 And Adam said This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my
flesh she shall be called Woman because she was taken out of Man

224 Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall
cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh

225 And they were both naked the man and his wife and were not
ashamed

31 Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which
the LORD God had made And he said unto the woman Yea hath God said
Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden  32 And the woman said
unto the serpent We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden
33 But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden
God hath said Ye shall not eat of it neither shall ye touch it lest
ye die
