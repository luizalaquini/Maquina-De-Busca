I know their reasons What are yours The honor of serving beside such paragons as Meryn Trant and Boros Blount He gave the boy a mocking grin To guard the king’s life you surrender your own You give up your lands and titles give up hope of marriage children…

House Tyrell continues through my brothers Ser Loras said It is not necessary for a third son to wed or breed

Not necessary but some find it pleasant What of love

When the sun has set no candle can replace it

Is that from a song Tyrion cocked his head smiling Yes you are seventeen I see that now

Ser Loras tensed Do you mock me

A prickly lad No If I’ve given offense forgive me I had my own love once and we had a song as well I loved a maid as fair as summer with sunlight in her hair He bid Ser Loras a good evening and went on his way

Near the kennels a group of men-at-arms were fighting a pair of dogs Tyrion stopped long enough to see the smaller dog tear half the face off the larger one and earned a few coarse laughs by observing that the loser now resembled Sandor Clegane Then hoping he had disarmed their suspicions he proceeded to the north wall and down the short flight of steps to the eunuch’s meager abode The door opened as he was lifting his hand to knock

Varys Tyrion slipped inside Are you there A single candle lit the gloom spicing the air with the scent of jasmine

My lord A woman sidled into the light plump soft matronly with a round pink moon of a face and heavy dark curls Tyrion recoiled Is something amiss she asked

Varys he realized with annoyance For one horrid moment I thought you’d brought me Lollys instead of Shae Where is she

Here m’lord She put her hands over his eyes from behind Can you guess what I’m wearing

Nothing

Oh you’re so smart she pouted snatching her hands away How did you know

You’re very beautiful in nothing

Am I she said Am I truly

Oh yes

Then shouldn’t you be fucking me instead of talking

We need to rid ourselves of Lady Varys first I am not the sort of dwarf who likes an audience

He’s gone Shae said

Tyrion turned to look It was true The eunuch had vanished skirts and all The hidden doors are here somewhere they have to be That was as much as he had time to think before Shae turned his head to kiss him Her mouth was wet and hungry and she did not even seem to see his scar or the raw scab where his nose had been Her skin was warm silk beneath his fingers When his thumb brushed against her left nipple it hardened at once Hurry she urged between kisses as his fingers went to his laces oh hurry hurry I want you in me in me in me He did not even have time to undress properly Shae pulled his cock out of his breeches then pushed him down onto the floor and climbed atop him She screamed as he pushed past her lips and rode him wildly moaning My giant my giant my giant every time she slammed down on him Tyrion was so eager that he exploded on the fifth stroke but Shae did not seem to mind She smiled wickedly when she felt him spurting and leaned forward to kiss the sweat from his brow My giant of Lannister she murmured Stay inside me please I like to feel you there

So Tyrion did not move except to put his arms around her It feels so good to hold her and to be held he thought How can something this sweet be a crime worth hanging her for Shae he said sweetling this must be our last time together The danger is too great If my lord father should find you…

I like your scar She traced it with her finger It makes you look very fierce and strong

He laughed Very ugly you mean

M’lord will never be ugly in my eyes She kissed the scab that covered the ragged stub of his nose

It’s not my face that need concern you it’s my father—

He does not frighten me Will m’lord give me back my jewels and silks now I asked Varys if I could have them when you were hurt in the battle but he wouldn’t give them to me What would have become of them if you’d died
