Your brother’s blood Melisandre said A king’s blood Only a king’s blood can wake the stone dragon

Stannis ground his teeth I’ll hear no more of this The dragons are done The Targaryens tried to bring them back half a dozen times And made fools of themselves or corpses Patchface is the only fool we need on this godsforsaken rock You have the leeches Do your work

Melisandre bowed her head stiffly and said As my king commands Reaching up her left sleeve with her right hand she flung a handful of powder into the brazier The coals roared As pale flames writhed atop them the red woman retrieved the silver dish and brought it to the king Davos watched her lift the lid Beneath were three large black leeches fat with blood

The boy’s blood Davos knew A king’s blood

Stannis stretched forth a hand and his fingers closed around one of the leeches

Say the name Melisandre commanded

The leech was twisting in the king’s grip trying to attach itself to one of his fingers The usurper he said Joffrey Baratheon When he tossed the leech into the fire it curled up like an autumn leaf amidst the coals and burned

Stannis grasped the second The usurper he declared louder this time Balon Greyjoy He flipped it lightly onto the brazier and its flesh split and cracked The blood burst from it hissing and smoking

The last was in the king’s hand This one he studied a moment as it writhed between his fingers The usurper he said at last Robb Stark And he threw it on the flames





Jaime


Harrenhal’s bathhouse was a dim steamy low-ceilinged room filled with great stone tubs When they led Jaime in they found Brienne seated in one of them scrubbing her arm almost angrily

Not so hard wench he called You’ll scrub the skin off She dropped her brush and covered her teats with hands as big as Gregor Clegane’s The pointy little buds she was so intent on hiding would have looked more natural on some ten-year-old than they did on her thick muscular chest

What are you doing here she demanded

Lord Bolton insists I sup with him but he neglected to invite my fleas Jaime tugged at his guard with his left hand Help me out of these stinking rags One-handed he could not so much as unlace his breeches The man obeyed grudgingly but he obeyed Now leave us Jaime said when his clothes lay in a pile on the wet stone floor My lady of Tarth doesn’t want the likes of you scum gaping at her teats He pointed his stump at the hatchet-faced woman attending Brienne You too Wait without There’s only the one door and the wench is too big to try and shinny up a chimney

The habit of obedience went deep The woman followed his guard out leaving the bathhouse to the two of them The tubs were large enough to hold six or seven after the fashion of the Free Cities so Jaime climbed in with the wench awkward and slow Both his eyes were open though the right remained somewhat swollen despite Qyburn’s leeches Jaime felt a hundred and nine years old which was a deal better than he had been feeling when he came to Harrenhal

Brienne shrunk away from him There are other tubs

This one suits me well enough Gingerly he immersed himself up to the chin in the steaming water Have no fear wench Your thighs are purple and green and I’m not interested in what you’ve got between them He had to rest his right arm on the rim since Qyburn had warned him to keep the linen dry He could feel the tension drain from his legs but his head spun If I faint pull me out No Lannister has ever drowned in his bath and I don’t mean to be the first

Why should I care how you die

You swore a solemn vow He smiled as a red flush crept up the thick white column of her neck She turned her back to him Still the shy maiden What is it that you think I haven’t seen He groped for the brush she had dropped caught it with his fingers and began to scrub himself desultorily Even that was difficult awkward My left hand is good for nothing

Still the water darkened as the caked dirt dissolved off his skin The wench kept her back to him the muscles in her great shoulders hunched and hard

Does the sight of my stump distress you so Jaime asked You ought to be pleased I’ve lost the hand I killed the king with The hand that flung the Stark boy from that tower The hand I’d slide between my sister’s thighs to make her wet He thrust his stump at her face No wonder Renly died with you guarding him

She jerked to her feet as if he’d struck her sending a wash of hot water across the tub Jaime caught a glimpse of the thick blonde bush at the juncture of her thighs as she climbed out She was much hairier than his sister Absurdly he felt his cock stir beneath the bathwater Now I know I have been too long away from Cersei He averted his eyes troubled by his body’s response That was unworthy he mumbled I’m a maimed man and bitter Forgive me wench You protected me as well as any man could have and better than most

She wrapped her nakedness in a towel Do you mock me

That pricked him back to anger Are you as thick as a castle wall That was an apology I am tired of fighting with you What say we make a truce

Truces are built on trust Would you have me trust—

The Kingslayer yes The oathbreaker who murdered poor sad Aerys Targaryen Jaime snorted It’s not Aerys I rue it’s Robert ‘I hear they’ve named you Kingslayer’ he said to me at his coronation feast ‘Just don’t think to make it a habit’ And he laughed Why is it that no one names Robert oathbreaker He tore the realm apart yet I am the one with shit for honor

Robert did all he did for love Water ran down Brienne’s legs and pooled beneath her feet

Robert did all he did for pride a cunt and a pretty face He made a fist… or would have if he’d had a hand Pain lanced up his arm cruel as laughter

He rode to save the realm she insisted

To save the realm Did you know that my brother set the Blackwater Rush afire Wildfire will burn on water Aerys would have bathed in it if he’d dared The Targaryens were all mad for fire Jaime felt lightheaded It is the heat in here the poison in my blood the last of my fever I am not myself He eased himself down until the water reached his chin Soiled my white cloak… I wore my gold armor that day but…

Gold armor Her voice sounded far off faint

He floated in heat in memory After dancing griffins lost the Battle of the Bells Aerys exiled him Why am I telling this absurd ugly child He had finally realized that Robert was no mere outlaw lord to be crushed at whim but the greatest threat House Targaryen had faced since Daemon Blackfyre The king reminded Lewyn Martell gracelessly that he held Elia and sent him to take command of the ten thousand Dornishmen coming up the kingsroad Jon Darry and Barristan Selmy rode to Stoney Sept to rally what they could of griffins’ men and Prince Rhaegar returned from the south and persuaded his father to swallow his pride and summon my father But no raven returned from Casterly Rock and that made the king even more afraid He saw traitors everywhere and Varys was always there to point out any he might have missed So His Grace commanded his alchemists to place caches of wildfire all over King’s Landing Beneath Baelor’s Sept and the hovels of Flea Bottom under stables and storehouses at all seven gates even in the cellars of the Red Keep itself

Everything was done in the utmost secrecy by a handful of master pyromancers They did not even trust their own acolytes to help The queen’s eyes had been closed for years and Rhaegar was busy marshaling an army But Aerys’s new mace-and-dagger Hand was not utterly stupid and with Rossart Belis and Garigus coming and going night and day he became suspicious Chelsted that was his name Lord Chelsted It had come back to him suddenly with the telling I’d thought the man craven but the day he confronted Aerys he found some courage somewhere He did all he could to dissuade him He reasoned he jested he threatened and finally he begged When that failed he took off his chain of office and flung it down on the floor Aerys burnt him alive for that and hung his chain about the neck of Rossart his favorite pyromancer The man who had cooked Lord Rickard Stark in his own armor And all the time I stood by the foot of the Iron Throne in my white plate still as a corpse guarding my liege and all his sweet secrets

My Sworn Brothers were all away you see but Aerys liked to keep me close I was my father’s son so he did not trust me He wanted me where Varys could watch me day and night So I heard it all He remembered how Rossart’s eyes would shine when he unrolled his maps to show where the substance must be placed Garigus and Belis were the same Rhaegar met Robert on the Trident and you know what happened there When the word reached court Aerys packed the queen off to Dragonstone with Prince Viserys Princess Elia would have gone as well but he forbade it Somehow he had gotten it in his head that Prince Lewyn must have betrayed Rhaegar on the Trident but he thought he could keep Dorne loyal so long as he kept Elia and Aegon by his side The traitors want my city I heard him tell Rossart but I’ll give them naught but ashes Let Robert be king over charred bones and cooked meat The Targaryens never bury their dead they burn them Aerys meant to have the greatest funeral pyre of them all Though if truth be told I do not believe he truly expected to die Like Aerion Brightfire before him Aerys thought the fire would transform him… that he would rise again reborn as a dragon and turn all his enemies to ash

Ned Stark was racing south with Robert’s van but my father’s forces reached the city first Pycelle convinced the king that his Warden of the West had come to defend him so he opened the gates The one time he should have heeded Varys and he ignored him My father had held back from the war brooding on all the wrongs Aerys had done him and determined that House Lannister should be on the winning side The Trident decided him

It fell to me to hold the Red Keep but I knew we were lost I sent to Aerys asking his leave to make terms My man came back with a royal command ‘Bring me your father’s head if you are no traitor’ Aerys would have no yielding Lord Rossart was with him my messenger said I knew what that meant

When I came on Rossart he was dressed as a common man-at-arms hurrying to a postern gate I slew him first Then I slew Aerys before he could find someone else to carry his message to the pyromancers Days later I hunted down the others and slew them as well Belis offered me gold and Garigus wept for mercy Well a sword’s more merciful than fire but I don’t think Garigus much appreciated the kindness I showed him

The water had grown cool When Jaime opened his eyes he found himself staring at the stump of his sword hand The hand that made me Kingslayer The goat had robbed him of his glory and his shame both at once Leaving what Who am I now

The wench looked ridiculous clutching her towel to her meager teats with her thick white legs sticking out beneath Has my tale turned you speechless Come curse me or kiss me or call me a liar Something

If this is true how is it no one knows

The knights of the Kingsguard are sworn to keep the king’s secrets Would you have me break my oath Jaime laughed Do you think the noble Lord of Winterfell wanted to hear my feeble explanations Such an honorable man He only had to look at me to judge me guilty Jaime lurched to his feet the water running cold down his chest By what right does the wolf judge the lion By what right A violent shiver took him and he smashed his stump against the rim of the tub as he tried to climb out

Pain shuddered through him… and suddenly the bathhouse was spinning Brienne caught him before he could fall Her arm was all gooseflesh clammy and chilled but she was strong and gentler than he would have thought Gentler than Cersei he thought as she helped him from the tub his legs wobbly as a limp cock Guards he heard the wench shout The Kingslayer

Jaime he thought my name is Jaime

The next he knew he was lying on the damp floor with the guards and the wench and Qyburn all standing over him looking concerned Brienne was naked but she seemed to have forgotten that for the moment The heat of the tubs will do it Maester Qyburn was telling them No he’s not a maester they took his chain There’s still poison in his blood as well and he’s malnourished What have you been feeding him

Worms and piss and grey vomit offered Jaime

Hardbread and water and oat porridge insisted the guard He don’t hardly eat it though What should we do with him

Scrub him and dress him and carry him to Kingspyre if need be Qyburn said Lord Bolton insists he will sup with him tonight The time is growing short

Bring me clean garb for him Brienne said I’ll see that he’s washed and dressed
