But not here she said dismayed It looks so   

   small and bleak and mean It’s all that and less The Fingers are a lovely place if you happen to be a stone But have no fear we shan’t stay more than a fortnight I expect your aunt is already riding to meet us He smiled The Lady Lysa and I are to be wed

Wed Sansa was stunned You and my aunt

The Lord of Harrenhal and the Lady of the Eyrie

You said it was my mother you loved But of course Lady Catelyn was dead so even if she had loved Petyr secretly and given him her maidenhood it made no matter now

So silent my lady said Petyr I was certain you would wish to give me your blessing It is a rare thing for a boy born heir to stones and sheep pellets to wed the daughter of Hoster Tully and the widow of Jon Arryn

I    I pray you will have long years together and many children and be very happy in one another It had been years since Sansa last saw her mother’s sister She will be kind to me for my mother’s sake surely She’s my own blood And the Vale of Arryn was beautiful all the songs said so Perhaps it would not be so terrible to stay here for a time

Lothor and old Oswell rowed them ashore Sansa huddled in the bow under her cloak with the hood drawn up against the wind wondering what awaited her Servants emerged from the tower to meet them a thin old woman and a fat middle-aged one two ancient white-haired men and a girl of two or three with a sty on one eye When they recognized Lord Petyr they knelt on the rocks My household he said I don’t know the child Another of Kella’s bastards I suppose She pops one out every few years

The two old men waded out up to their thighs to lift Sansa from the boat so she would not get her skirts wet Oswell and Lothor splashed their way ashore as did Littlefinger himself He gave the old woman a kiss on the cheek and grinned at the younger one Who fathered this one Kella

The fat woman laughed I can’t rightly say m’lord I’m not one for telling them no

And all the local lads are grateful I am quite sure

It is good to have you home my lord said one old man He looked to be at least eighty but he wore a studded brigantine and a longsword at his side How long will you be in residence

As short a time as possible Bryen have no fear Is the place habitable just now would you say

If we knew you was coming we would have laid down fresh rushes m’lord said the crone There’s a dung fire burning

Nothing says home like the smell of burning dung Petyr turned to Sansa Grisel was my wet nurse but she keeps my castle now Umfred’s my steward and Bryen—didn’t I name you captain of the guard the last time I was here

You did my lord You said you’d be getting some more men too but you never did Me and the dogs stand all the watches

And very well I’m sure No one has made off with any of my rocks or sheep pellets I see that plainly Petyr gestured toward the fat woman Kella minds my vast herds How many sheep do I have at present Kella

She had to think a moment Three and twenty m’lord There was nine and twenty but Bryen’s dogs killed one and we butchered some others and salted down the meat

Ah cold salt mutton I must be home When I break my fast on gulls’ eggs and seaweed soup I’ll be certain of it

If you like m’lord said the old woman Grisel

Lord Petyr made a face Come let’s see if my hall is as dreary as I recall He led them up the strand over rocks slick with rotting seaweed A handful of sheep were wandering about the base of the flint tower grazing on the thin grass that grew between the sheepfold and thatched stable Sansa had to step carefully there were pellets everywhere

Within the tower seemed even smaller An open stone stair wound round the inside wall from undercroft to roof Each floor was but a single room The servants lived and slept in the kitchen at ground level sharing the space with a huge brindled mastiff and a half-dozen sheep-dogs Above that was a modest hall and higher still the bedchamber There were no windows but arrowslits were embedded in the outer wall at intervals along the curve of the stair Above the hearth hung a broken longsword and a battered oaken shield its paint cracked and flaking

The device painted on the shield was one Sansa did not know a grey stone head with fiery eyes upon a light green field My grandfather’s shield Petyr explained when he saw her gazing at it His own father was born in Braavos and came to the Vale as a sellsword in the hire of Lord Corbray so my grandfather took the head of the Titan as his sigil when he was knighted

It’s very fierce said Sansa

Rather too fierce for an amiable fellow like me said Petyr I much prefer my mockingbird

Oswell made two more trips out to the Merling King to offload provisions Among the loads he brought ashore were several casks of wine Petyr poured Sansa a cup as promised Here my lady that should help your tummy I would hope

Having solid ground beneath her feet had helped already but Sansa dutifully lifted the goblet with both hands and took a sip The wine was very fine an Arbor vintage she thought It tasted of oak and fruit and hot summer nights the flavors blossoming in her mouth like flowers opening to the sun She only prayed that she could keep it down Lord Petyr was being so kind she did not want to spoil it all by retching on him

He was studying her over his own goblet his bright grey-green eyes full of    was it amusement Or something else Sansa was not certain Grisel he called to the old woman bring some food up Nothing too heavy my lady has a tender tummy Some fruit might serve perhaps Oswell’s brought some oranges and pomegranates from the King

Yes m’lord

Might I have a hot bath as well asked Sansa

I’ll have Kella draw some water m’lady

Sansa took another sip of wine and tried to think of some polite conversation but Lord Petyr saved her the effort When Grisel and the other servants had gone he said Lysa will not come alone Before she arrives we must be clear on who you are

Who I    I don’t understand

Varys has informers everywhere If Sansa Stark should be seen in the Vale the eunuch will know within a moon’s turn and that would create unfortunate    complications It is not safe to be a Stark just now So we shall tell Lysa’s people that you are my natural daughter

Natural Sansa was aghast You mean a bastard

Well you can scarcely be my trueborn daughter I’ve never taken a wife that’s well known What should you be called

I    I could call myself after my mother   

Catelyn A bit too obvious    but after my mother that would serve Alayne Do you like it

Alayne is pretty Sansa hoped she would remember But couldn’t I be the trueborn daughter of some knight in your service Perhaps he died gallantly in the battle and   

I have no gallant knights in my service Alayne Such a tale would draw unwanted questions as a corpse draws crows It is rude to pry into the origins of a man’s natural children however He cocked his head So who are you

Alayne    Stone would it be When he nodded she said But who is my mother

Kella

Please no she said mortified

I was teasing Your mother was a gentlewoman of Braavos daughter of a merchant prince We met in Gulltown when I had charge of the port She died giving you birth and entrusted you to the Faith I have some devotional books you can look over Learn to quote from them Nothing discourages unwanted questions as much as a flow of pious bleating In any case at your flowering you decided you did not wish to be a septa and wrote to me That was the first I knew of your existence He fingered his beard Do you think you can remember all that

I hope It will be like playing a game won’t it

Are you fond of games Alayne

The new name would take some getting used to Games I    I suppose it would depend   

Grisel reappeared before he could say more balancing a large platter She set it down between them There were apples and pears and pomegranates some sad-looking grapes a huge blood orange The old woman had brought a round of bread as well and a crock of butter Petyr cut a pomegranate in two with his dagger offering half to Sansa You should try and eat my lady

Thank you my lord Pomegranate seeds were so messy Sansa chose a pear instead and took a small delicate bite It was very ripe The juice ran down her chin

Lord Petyr loosened a seed with the point of his dagger You must miss your father terribly I know Lord Eddard was a brave man honest and loyal    but quite a hopeless player He brought the seed to his mouth with the knife In King’s Landing there are two sorts of people The players and the pieces
