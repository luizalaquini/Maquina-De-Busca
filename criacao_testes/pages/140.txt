Eleazar his son and Aaron died there in the top of the mount and
Moses and Eleazar came down from the mount

2029 And when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead they
mourned for Aaron thirty days even all the house of Israel

211 And when king Arad the Canaanite which dwelt in the south heard
tell that Israel came by the way of the spies then he fought against
Israel and took some of them prisoners

212 And Israel vowed a vow unto the LORD and said If thou wilt
indeed deliver this people into my hand then I will utterly destroy
their cities

213 And the LORD hearkened to the voice of Israel and delivered up
the Canaanites and they utterly destroyed them and their cities and
he called the name of the place Hormah

214 And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea to
compass the land of Edom and the soul of the people was much
discouraged because of the way

215 And the people spake against God and against Moses Wherefore
have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness for there
is no bread neither is there any water and our soul loatheth this
light bread

216 And the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people and they bit
the people and much people of Israel died

217 Therefore the people came to Moses and said We have sinned for
we have spoken against the LORD and against thee pray unto the LORD
that he take away the serpents from us And Moses prayed for the
people

218 And the LORD said unto Moses Make thee a fiery serpent and set
it upon a pole and it shall come to pass that every one that is
bitten when he looketh upon it shall live

219 And Moses made a serpent of brass and put it upon a pole and it
came to pass that if a serpent had bitten any man when he beheld the
serpent of brass he lived

2110 And the children of Israel set forward and pitched in Oboth

2111 And they journeyed from Oboth and pitched at Ijeabarim in the
wilderness which is before Moab toward the sunrising

2112 From thence they removed and pitched in the valley of Zared

2113 From thence they removed and pitched on the other side of
Arnon which is in the wilderness that cometh out of the coasts of the
Amorites for Arnon is the border of Moab between Moab and the
Amorites

2114 Wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the LORD What
he did in the Red sea and in the brooks of Arnon 2115 And at the
stream of the brooks that goeth down to the dwelling of Ar and lieth
upon the border of Moab

2116 And from thence they went to Beer that is the well whereof the
LORD spake unto Moses Gather the people together and I will give
them water

2117 Then Israel sang this song Spring up O well sing ye unto it
2118 The princes digged the well the nobles of the people digged it
by the direction of the lawgiver with their staves And from the
wilderness they went to Mattanah 2119 And from Mattanah to Nahaliel
and from Nahaliel to Bamoth 2120 And from Bamoth in the valley that
is in the country of Moab to the top of Pisgah which looketh toward
Jeshimon

2121 And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites
saying 2122 Let me pass through thy land we will not turn into the
fields or into the vineyards we will not drink of the waters of the
well but we will go along by the kings high way until we be past
thy borders

2123 And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border
but Sihon gathered all his people together and went out against
Israel into the wilderness and he came to Jahaz and fought against
Israel

2124 And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword and possessed
his land from Arnon unto Jabbok even unto the children of Ammon for
the border of the children of Ammon was strong

2125 And Israel took all these cities and Israel dwelt in all the
cities of the Amorites in Heshbon and in all the villages thereof

2126 For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites who
had fought against the former king of Moab and taken all his land out
of his hand even unto Arnon

2127 Wherefore they that speak in proverbs say Come into Heshbon
let the city of Sihon be built and prepared 2128 For there is a fire
gone out of Heshbon a flame from the city of Sihon it hath consumed
Ar of Moab and the lords of the high places of Arnon

2129 Woe to thee Moab thou art undone O people of Chemosh he hath
