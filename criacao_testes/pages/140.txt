I know child The black fish that fastened his cloak was Brynden’s only concession to ornament I had to hear it from Maester Colemon I asked your sister for leave to take a thousand seasoned men and ride for Riverrun with all haste Do you know what she told me The Vale cannot spare a thousand swords nor even one Uncle she said You are the Knight of the Gate Your place is here A gust of childish laughter drifted through the open doors behind him and her uncle glanced darkly over his shoulder Well I told her she could bloody well find herself a new Knight of the Gate Black fish or no I am still a Tully I shall leave for Riverrun by evenfall

Catelyn could not pretend to surprise Alone You know as well as I that you will never survive the high road Ser Rodrik and I are returning to Winterfell Come with us Uncle I will give you your thousand men Riverrun will not fight alone

Brynden thought a moment then nodded a brusque agreement As you say It’s the long way home but I’m more like to get there I’ll wait for you below He went striding off his cloak swirling behind him

Catelyn exchanged a look with Ser Rodrik They went through the doors to the high nervous sound of a child’s giggles

Lysa’s apartments opened over a small garden a circle of dirt and grass planted with blue flowers and ringed on all sides by tall white towers The builders had intended it as a godswood but the Eyrie rested on the hard stone of the mountain and no matter how much soil was hauled up from the Vale they could not get a weirwood to take root here So the Lords of the Eyrie planted grass and scattered statuary amidst low flowering shrubs It was there the two champions would meet to place their lives and that of Tyrion Lannister into the hands of the gods

Lysa freshly scrubbed and garbed in cream velvet with a rope of sapphires and moonstones around her milk-white neck was holding court on the terrace overlooking the scene of the combat surrounded by her knights retainers and lords high and low Most of them still hoped to wed her bed her and rule the Vale of Arryn by her side From what Catelyn had seen during her stay at the Eyrie it was a vain hope

A wooden platform had been built to elevate Robert’s chair there the Lord of the Eyrie sat giggling and clapping his hands as a humpbacked puppeteer in blue-and-white motley made two wooden knights hack and slash at each other Pitchers of thick cream and baskets of blackberries had been set out and the guests were sipping a sweet orange-scented wine from engraved silver cups A fool’s festival Brynden had called it and small wonder

Across the terrace Lysa laughed gaily at some jest of Lord Hunter’s and nibbled a blackberry from the point of Ser Lyn Corbray’s dagger They were the suitors who stood highest in Lysa’s favor… today at least Catelyn would have been hard-pressed to say which man was more unsuitable Eon Hunter was even older than Jon Arryn had been half-crippled by gout and cursed with three quarrelsome sons each more grasping than the last Ser Lyn was a different sort of folly lean and handsome heir to an ancient but impoverished house but vain reckless hot-tempered… and it was whispered notoriously uninterested in the intimate charms of women

When Lysa espied Catelyn she welcomed her with a sisterly embrace and a moist kiss on the cheek Isn’t it a lovely morning The gods are smiling on us Do try a cup of the wine sweet sister Lord Hunter was kind enough to send for it from his own cellars

Thank you no Lysa we must talk

After her sister promised already beginning to turn away from her

Now Catelyn spoke more loudly than she’d intended Men were turning to look Lysa you cannot mean to go ahead with this folly Alive the Imp has value Dead he is only food for crows And if his champion should prevail here—

Small chance of that my lady Lord Hunter assured her patting her shoulder with a liver-spotted hand Ser Vardis is a doughty fighter He will make short work of the sellsword

Will he my lord Catelyn said coolly I wonder She had seen Bronn fight on the high road it was no accident that he had survived the journey while other men had died He moved like a panther and that ugly sword of his seemed a part of his arm

Lysa’s suitors were gathering around them like bees round a blossom Women understand little of these things Ser Morton Waynwood said Ser Vardis is a knight sweet lady This other fellow well his sort are all cowards at heart Useful enough in a battle with thousands of their fellows around them but stand them up alone and the manhood leaks right out of them

Say you have the truth of it then Catelyn said with a courtesy that made her mouth ache What will we gain by the dwarf’s death Do you imagine that Jaime will care a fig that we gave his brother a trial before we flung him off a mountain

Behead the man Ser Lyn Corbray suggested When the Kingslayer receives the Imp’s head it will be a warning to him

Lysa gave an impatient shake of her waist-long auburn hair Lord Robert wants to see him fly she said as if that settled the matter And the Imp has only himself to blame It was he who demanded a trial by combat

Lady Lysa had no honorable way to deny him even if she’d wished to Lord Hunter intoned ponderously

Ignoring them all Catelyn turned all her force on her sister I remind you Tyrion Lannister is my prisoner

And I remind you the dwarf murdered my lord husband Her voice rose He poisoned the Hand of the King and left my sweet baby fatherless and now I mean to see him pay Whirling her skirts swinging around her Lysa stalked across the terrace Ser Lyn and Ser Morton and the other suitors excused themselves with cool nods and trailed after her

Do you think he did Ser Rodrik asked her quietly when they were alone again Murder Lord Jon that is The Imp still denies it and most fiercely…

I believe the Lannisters murdered Lord Arryn Catelyn replied but whether it was Tyrion or Ser Jaime or the queen or all of them together I could not begin to say Lysa had named Cersei in the letter she had sent to Winterfell but now she seemed certain that Tyrion was the killer… perhaps because the dwarf was here while the queen was safe behind the walls of the Red Keep hundreds of leagues to the south Catelyn almost wished she had burned her sister’s letter before reading it

Ser Rodrik tugged at his whiskers Poison well… that could be the dwarf’s work true enough Or Cersei’s It’s said poison is a woman’s weapon begging your pardons my lady The Kingslayer now… I have no great liking for the man but he’s not the sort Too fond of the sight of blood on that golden sword of his Was it poison my lady

Catelyn frowned vaguely uneasy How else could they make it look a natural death Behind her Lord Robert shrieked with delight as one of the puppet knights sliced the other in half spilling a flood of red sawdust onto the terrace She glanced at her nephew and sighed The boy is utterly without discipline He will never be strong enough to rule unless he is taken away from his mother for a time

His lord father agreed with you said a voice at her elbow She turned to behold Maester Colemon a cup of wine in his hand He was planning to send the boy to Dragonstone for fostering you know… oh but I’m speaking out of turn The apple of his throat bobbed anxiously beneath the loose maester’s chain I fear I’ve had too much of Lord Hunter’s excellent wine The prospect of bloodshed has my nerves all a-fray…

You are mistaken Maester Catelyn said It was Casterly Rock not Dragonstone and those arrangements were made after the Hand’s death without my sister’s consent
