HOUSE GREYJOY

The Greyjoys of Pyke claim descent from the Grey King of the Age of Heroes Legend says the Grey King ruled not only the western isles but the sea itself and took a mermaid to wife



For thousands of years raiders from the Iron Islands—called ironmen by those they plundered—were the terrors of the seas sailing as far as the Port of Ibben and the Summer Isles They prided themselves on their fierceness in battle and their sacred freedoms Each island had its own salt king and rock king The High King of the Isles was chosen from among their number until King Urron made the throne hereditary by murdering the other kings when they assembled for a choosing Urron’s own line was extinguished a thousand years later when the Andals swept over the islands The Greyjoys like other island lords intermarried with the conquerors



The Iron Kings extended their rule far beyond the isles themselves carving kingdoms out of the mainland with fire and sword King Qhored could truthfully boast that his writ ran wherever men can smell salt water or hear the crash of waves In later centuries Qhored’s descendants lost the Arbor Oldtown Bear Island and much of the western shore Still come the Wars of Conquest King Harren the Black ruled all the lands between the mountains from the Neck to the Blackwater Rush When Harren and his sons perished in the fall of Harrenhal Aegon Targaryen granted the riverlands to House Tully and allowed the surviving lords of the Iron Islands to revive their ancient custom and choose who should have the primacy among them They chose Lord Vickon Greyjoy of Pyke



The Greyjoy sigil is a golden kraken upon a black field Their words are We Do Not Sow
