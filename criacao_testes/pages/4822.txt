said For now the LORD hath made room for us and we shall be fruitful
in the land

2623 And he went up from thence to Beersheba

2624 And the LORD appeared unto him the same night and said I am
the God of Abraham thy father fear not for I am with thee and will
bless thee and multiply thy seed for my servant Abrahams sake

2625 And he builded an altar there and called upon the name of the
LORD and pitched his tent there and there Isaacs servants digged a
well

2626 Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar and Ahuzzath one of his
friends and Phichol the chief captain of his army

2627 And Isaac said unto them Wherefore come ye to me seeing ye
hate me and have sent me away from you  2628 And they said We saw
certainly that the LORD was with thee and we said Let there be now
an oath betwixt us even betwixt us and thee and let us make a
covenant with thee 2629 That thou wilt do us no hurt as we have not
touched thee and as we have done unto thee nothing but good and have
sent thee away in peace thou art now the blessed of the LORD

2630 And he made them a feast and they did eat and drink

2631 And they rose up betimes in the morning and sware one to
another and Isaac sent them away and they departed from him in
peace

2632 And it came to pass the same day that Isaacs servants came
and told him concerning the well which they had digged and said unto
him We have found water

2633 And he called it Shebah therefore the name of the city is
Beersheba unto this day

2634 And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the
daughter of Beeri the Hittite and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the
Hittite 2635 Which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah

271 And it came to pass that when Isaac was old and his eyes were
dim so that he could not see he called Esau his eldest son and said
unto him My son and he said unto him Behold here am I

272 And he said Behold now I am old I know not the day of my
death 273 Now therefore take I pray thee thy weapons thy quiver
and thy bow and go out to the field and take me some venison 274
And make me savoury meat such as I love and bring it to me that I
may eat that my soul may bless thee before I die

275 And Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son And Esau went
to the field to hunt for venison and to bring it

276 And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son saying Behold I heard thy
father speak unto Esau thy brother saying 277 Bring me venison and
make me savoury meat that I may eat and bless thee before the LORD
before my death

278 Now therefore my son obey my voice according to that which I
command thee

279 Go now to the flock and fetch me from thence two good kids of
the goats and I will make them savoury meat for thy father such as
he loveth 2710 And thou shalt bring it to thy father that he may
eat and that he may bless thee before his death

2711 And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother Behold Esau my brother is
a hairy man and I am a smooth man 2712 My father peradventure will
feel me and I shall seem to him as a deceiver and I shall bring a
curse upon me and not a blessing

2713 And his mother said unto him Upon me be thy curse my son only
obey my voice and go fetch me them

2714 And he went and fetched and brought them to his mother and
his mother made savoury meat such as his father loved

2715 And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau which
were with her in the house and put them upon Jacob her younger son
2716 And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands
and upon the smooth of his neck 2717 And she gave the savoury meat
and the bread which she had prepared into the hand of her son Jacob

2718 And he came unto his father and said My father and he said
Here am I who art thou my son  2719 And Jacob said unto his
father I am Esau thy first born I have done according as thou badest
me arise I pray thee sit and eat of my venison that thy soul may
bless me

2720 And Isaac said unto his son How is it that thou hast found it
so quickly my son And he said Because the LORD thy God brought it
to me

2721 And Isaac said unto Jacob Come near I pray thee that I may
feel thee my son whether thou be my very son Esau or not

2722 And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father and he felt him and
said The voice is Jacobs voice but the hands are the hands of Esau
