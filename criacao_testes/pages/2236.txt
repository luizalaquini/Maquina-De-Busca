Robb had donned his crown before coming to the hall and the bronze shone darkly in the torchlight Shadows hid his eyes as he looked upon the dead Does he see Bran and Rickon as well She might have wept but there were no tears left in her The dead boys were pale from long imprisonment and both had been fair against their smooth white skin the blood was shockingly red unbearable to look upon Will they lay Sansa down naked beneath the Iron Throne after they have killed her Will her skin seem as white her blood as red From outside came the steady wash of rain and the restless howling of a wolf

Her brother Edmure stood to Robb’s right one hand upon the back of his father’s seat his face still puffy from sleep They had woken him as they had her pounding on his door in the black of night to yank him rudely from his dreams Were they good dreams brother Do you dream of sunlight and laughter and a maiden’s kisses I pray you do Her own dreams were dark and laced with terrors

Robb’s captains and lords bannermen stood about the hall some mailed and armed others in various states of dishevelment and undress Ser Raynald and his uncle Ser Rolph were among them but Robb had seen fit to spare his queen this ugliness The Crag is not far from Casterly Rock Catelyn recalled Jeyne may well have played with these boys when all of them were children

She looked down again upon the corpses of the squires Tion Frey and Willem Lannister and waited for her son to speak

It seemed a very long time before Robb lifted his eyes from the bloody dead Smalljon he said tell your father to bring them in Wordless Smalljon Umber turned to obey his steps echoing in the great stone hall

As the Greatjon marched his prisoners through the doors Catelyn made note of how some other men stepped back to give them room as if treason could somehow be passed by a touch a glance a cough The captors and the captives looked much alike big men every one with thick beards and long hair Two of the Greatjon’s men were wounded and three of their prisoners Only the fact that some had spears and others empty scabbards served to set them apart All were clad in mail hauberks or shirts of sewn rings with heavy boots and thick cloaks some of wool and some of fur The north is hard and cold and has no mercy Ned had told her when she first came to Winterfell a thousand years ago

Five said Robb when the prisoners stood before him wet and silent Is that all of them

There were eight rumbled the Greatjon We killed two taking them and a third is dying now

Robb studied the faces of the captives It required eight of you to kill two unarmed squires

Edmure Tully spoke up They murdered two of my men as well to get into the tower Delp and Elwood

It was no murder ser said Lord Rickard Karstark no more discomfited by the ropes about his wrists than by the blood that trickled down his face Any man who steps between a father and his vengeance asks for death

His words rang against Catelyn’s ears harsh and cruel as the pounding of a war drum Her throat was dry as bone I did this These two boys died so my daughters might live

I saw your sons die that night in the Whispering Wood Robb told Lord Karstark Tion Frey did not kill Torrhen Willem Lannister did not slay Eddard How then can you call this vengeance This was folly and bloody murder Your sons died honorably on a battlefield with swords in their hands

They died said Rickard Karstark yielding no inch of ground The Kingslayer cut them down These two were of his ilk Only blood can pay for blood

The blood of children Robb pointed at the corpses How old were they Twelve thirteen Squires

Squires die in every battle

Die fighting yes Tion Frey and Willem Lannister gave up their swords in the Whispering Wood They were captives locked in a cell asleep unarmed    boys Look at them

Lord Karstark looked instead at Catelyn Tell your mother to look at them he said She slew them as much as I

Catelyn put a hand on the back of Robb’s seat The hall seemed to spin about her She felt as though she might retch

My mother had naught to do with this Robb said angrily This was your work Your murder Your treason

How can it be treason to kill Lannisters when it is not treason to free them asked Karstark harshly Has Your Grace forgotten that we are at war with Casterly Rock In war you kill your enemies Didn’t your father teach you that boy

Boy The Greatjon dealt Rickard Karstark a buffet with a mailed fist that sent the other lord to his knees

Leave him Robb’s voice rang with command Umber stepped back away from the captive

Lord Karstark spit out a broken tooth Yes Lord Umber leave me to the king He means to give me a scolding before he forgives me That’s how he deals with treason our King in the North He smiled a wet red smile Or should I call you the King Who Lost the North Your Grace

The Greatjon snatched a spear from the man beside him and jerked it to his shoulder Let me spit him sire Let me open his belly so we can see the color of his guts

The doors of the hall crashed open and the Blackfish entered with water running from his cloak and helm Tully men-at-arms followed him in while outside lightning cracked across the sky and a hard black rain pounded against the stones of Riverrun Ser Brynden removed his helm and went to one knee Your Grace was all he said but the grimness of his tone spoke volumes

I will hear Ser Brynden privily in the audience chamber Robb rose to his feet Greatjon keep Lord Karstark here till I return and hang the other seven

The Greatjon lowered the spear Even the dead ones

Yes I will not have such fouling my lord uncle’s rivers Let them feed the crows

One of the captives dropped to his knees Mercy sire I killed no one I only stood at the door to watch for guards

Robb considered that a moment Did you know what Lord Rickard intended Did you see the knives drawn Did you hear the shouts the screams the cries for mercy

Aye I did but I took no part I was only the watcher I swear it   

Lord Umber said Robb this one was only the watcher Hang him last so he may watch the others die Mother Uncle with me if you please He turned away as the Greatjon’s men closed upon the prisoners and drove them from the hall at spearpoint Outside the thunder crashed and boomed so loud it sounded as if the castle were coming down about their ears Is this the sound of a kingdom falling Catelyn wondered

It was dark within the audience chamber but at least the sound of the thunder was muffled by another thickness of wall A servant entered with an oil lamp to light the fire but Robb sent him away and kept the lamp There were tables and chairs but only Edmure sat and he rose again when he realized that the others had remainded standing Robb took off his crown and placed it on the table before him

The Blackfish shut the door The Karstarks are gone

All Was it anger or despair that thickened Robb’s voice like that Even Catelyn was not certain

All the fighting men Ser Brynden replied A few camp followers and serving men were left with their wounded We questioned as many as we needed to be certain of the truth They started leaving at nightfall stealing off in ones and twos at first and then in larger groups The wounded men and servants were told to keep the campfires lit so no one would know they’d gone but once the rains began it didn’t matter

Will they re-form away from Riverrun asked Robb

No They’ve scattered hunting Lord Karstark has sworn to give the hand of his maiden daughter to any man highborn or low who brings him the head of the Kingslayer

Gods be good Catelyn felt ill again

Near three hundred riders and twice as many mounts melted away in the night Robb rubbed his temples where the crown had left its mark in the soft skin above his ears All the mounted strength of Karhold lost

Lost by me By me may the gods forgive me Catelyn did not need to be a soldier to grasp the trap Robb was in For the moment he held the riverlands but his kingdom was surrounded by enemies to every side but east where Lysa sat aloof on her mountaintop Even the Trident was scarce secure so long as the Lord of the Crossing withheld his allegiance And now to lose the Karstarks as well   

No word of this must leave Riverrun her brother Edmure said Lord Tywin would    the Lannisters pay their debts they are always saying that Mother have mercy when he hears

Sansa Catelyn’s nails dug into the soft flesh of her palms so hard did she close her hand

Robb gave Edmure a look that chilled Would you make me a liar as well as a murderer Uncle

We need speak no falsehood Only say nothing Bury the boys and hold our tongues till the war’s done Willem was son to Ser Kevan Lannister and Lord Tywin’s nephew Tion was Lady Genna’s and a Frey We must keep the news from the Twins as well until   

Until we can bring the murdered dead back to life said Brynden Blackfish sharply The truth escaped with the Karstarks Edmure It is too late for such games

I owe their fathers truth said Robb And justice I owe them that as well He gazed at his crown the dark gleam of bronze the circle of iron swords Lord Rickard defied me Betrayed me I have no choice but to condemn him Gods know what the Karstark foot with Roose Bolton will do when they hear I’ve executed their liege for a traitor Bolton must be warned

Lord Karstark’s heir was at Harrenhal as well Ser Brynden reminded him The eldest son the one the Lannisters took captive on the Green Fork

Harrion His name is Harrion Robb laughed bitterly A king had best know the names of his enemies don’t you think
