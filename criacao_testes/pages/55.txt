98 And the LORD said unto Moses and unto Aaron Take to you handfuls
of ashes of the furnace and let Moses sprinkle it toward the heaven
in the sight of Pharaoh

99 And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt and shall
be a boil breaking forth with blains upon man and upon beast
throughout all the land of Egypt

910 And they took ashes of the furnace and stood before Pharaoh and
Moses sprinkled it up toward heaven and it became a boil breaking
forth with blains upon man and upon beast

911 And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the
boils for the boil was upon the magicians and upon all the
Egyptians

912 And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh and he hearkened not
unto them as the LORD had spoken unto Moses

913 And the LORD said unto Moses Rise up early in the morning and
stand before Pharaoh and say unto him Thus saith the LORD God of the
Hebrews Let my people go that they may serve me

914 For I will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart and
upon thy servants and upon thy people that thou mayest know that
there is none like me in all the earth

915 For now I will stretch out my hand that I may smite thee and thy
people with pestilence and thou shalt be cut off from the earth

916 And in very deed for this cause have I raised thee up for to
shew in thee my power and that my name may be declared throughout all
the earth

917 As yet exaltest thou thyself against my people that thou wilt
not let them go  918 Behold to morrow about this time I will cause
it to rain a very grievous hail such as hath not been in Egypt since
the foundation thereof even until now

919 Send therefore now and gather thy cattle and all that thou hast
in the field for upon every man and beast which shall be found in the
field and shall not be brought home the hail shall come down upon
them and they shall die

920 He that feared the word of the LORD among the servants of Pharaoh
made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses 921 And he
that regarded not the word of the LORD left his servants and his
cattle in the field

922 And the LORD said unto Moses Stretch forth thine hand toward
heaven that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt upon man and
upon beast and upon every herb of the field throughout the land of
Egypt

923 And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven and the LORD
sent thunder and hail and the fire ran along upon the ground and the
LORD rained hail upon the land of Egypt

924 So there was hail and fire mingled with the hail very grievous
such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it
became a nation

925 And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that was
in the field both man and beast and the hail smote every herb of the
field and brake every tree of the field

926 Only in the land of Goshen where the children of Israel were
was there no hail

927 And Pharaoh sent and called for Moses and Aaron and said unto
them I have sinned this time the LORD is righteous and I and my
people are wicked

928 Intreat the LORD for it is enough that there be no more mighty
thunderings and hail and I will let you go and ye shall stay no
longer

929 And Moses said unto him As soon as I am gone out of the city I
will spread abroad my hands unto the LORD and the thunder shall
cease neither shall there be any more hail that thou mayest know how
that the earth is the LORDs

930 But as for thee and thy servants I know that ye will not yet
fear the LORD God

931 And the flax and the barley was smitten for the barley was in
the ear and the flax was bolled

932 But the wheat and the rie were not smitten for they were not
grown up

933 And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh and spread abroad
his hands unto the LORD and the thunders and hail ceased and the
rain was not poured upon the earth

934 And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders
were ceased he sinned yet more and hardened his heart he and his
servants
