The word vocoder is a contraction
of
ul
voc
ice
ul
coder
The energy in each filter band is
estimated by rectification and smoothing and the resulting approximation to
the frequency spectrum is transmitted or stored  The source properties are
represented by the type of excitation voiced or unvoiced and if voiced
the pitch  It is not necessary to include the overall amplitude of the speech
explicitly because this is conveyed by the energy levels from the separate
bandpass filters

We will discuss the block labelled pre-emphasis shortly
The shape of the spectrum is estimated by 19 bandpass filters whose spacing
and bandwidth decrease slightly with decreasing frequency to obtain the rather
greater resolution that is needed in the lower frequency region

Holmes 1980 JSRU channel vocoder

The 3 dB points
of adjacent filters are halfway between their centre frequencies so that there
is some overlap between bands
The filter characteristics do not need to have very sharp edges because the energy
in neighbouring bands is fairly highly correlated  Indeed there is a
disadvantage in making them too sharp because the phase delays associated
with sharp cutoff filters induce smearing of the spectrum in the time domain
This particular channel vocoder uses second-order Butterworth bandpass filters
pp
For regenerating speech stored in this way an excitation of unit impulses
at the specified pitch period for voiced sounds or white noise for unvoiced
sounds is produced and passed through a bank of bandpass filters similar
to the analysis ones  The excitation has a flat spectrum for regular impulses
have harmonics at multiples of the repetition frequency which are all of the
same size and so the spectrum of the output signal is completely determined
by the filter bank  The gain of each filter is controlled by the stored
magnitude of the spectrum at that frequency
pp
The frequency spectrum and voicing pitch of speech change at much slower rates
than the time waveform  The changes are due to movements of the articulatory
organs tongue lips etc in the speaker and so are limited in their speed
by physical constraints  A typical rate of production of phonemes is 15 per
