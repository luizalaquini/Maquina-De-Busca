I believe the Lannisters murdered Lord Arryn Catelyn replied but whether it was Tyrion or Ser Jaime or the queen or all of them together I could not begin to say Lysa had named Cersei in the letter she had sent to Winterfell but now she seemed certain that Tyrion was the killer… perhaps because the dwarf was here while the queen was safe behind the walls of the Red Keep hundreds of leagues to the south Catelyn almost wished she had burned her sister’s letter before reading it

Ser Rodrik tugged at his whiskers Poison well… that could be the dwarf’s work true enough Or Cersei’s It’s said poison is a woman’s weapon begging your pardons my lady The Kingslayer now… I have no great liking for the man but he’s not the sort Too fond of the sight of blood on that golden sword of his Was it poison my lady

Catelyn frowned vaguely uneasy How else could they make it look a natural death Behind her Lord Robert shrieked with delight as one of the puppet knights sliced the other in half spilling a flood of red sawdust onto the terrace She glanced at her nephew and sighed The boy is utterly without discipline He will never be strong enough to rule unless he is taken away from his mother for a time

His lord father agreed with you said a voice at her elbow She turned to behold Maester Colemon a cup of wine in his hand He was planning to send the boy to Dragonstone for fostering you know… oh but I’m speaking out of turn The apple of his throat bobbed anxiously beneath the loose maester’s chain I fear I’ve had too much of Lord Hunter’s excellent wine The prospect of bloodshed has my nerves all a-fray…

You are mistaken Maester Catelyn said It was Casterly Rock not Dragonstone and those arrangements were made after the Hand’s death without my sister’s consent

The maester’s head jerked so vigorously at the end of his absurdly long neck that he looked half a puppet himself No begging your forgiveness my lady but it was Lord Jon who—

A bell tolled loudly below them High lords and serving girls alike broke off what they were doing and moved to the balustrade Below two guardsmen in sky-blue cloaks led forth Tyrion Lannister The Eyrie’s plump septon escorted him to the statue in the center of the garden a weeping woman carved in veined white marble no doubt meant to be Alyssa

The bad little man Lord Robert said giggling Mother can I make him fly I want to see him fly

Later my sweet baby Lysa promised him

Trial first drawled Ser Lyn Corbray then execution

A moment later the two champions appeared from opposite sides of the garden The knight was attended by two young squires the sellsword by the Eyrie’s master-at-arms

Ser Vardis Egen was steel from head to heel encased in heavy plate armor over mail and padded surcoat Large circular rondels enameled cream-and-blue in the moon-and-falcon sigil of House Arryn protected the vulnerable juncture of arm and breast A skirt of lobstered metal covered him from waist to midthigh while a solid gorget encircled his throat Falcon’s wings sprouted from the temples of his helm and his visor was a pointed metal beak with a narrow slit for vision

Bronn was so lightly armored he looked almost naked beside the knight He wore only a shirt of black oiled ringmail over boiled leather a round steel halfhelm with a noseguard and a mail coif High leather boots with steel shinguards gave some protection to his legs and discs of black iron were sewn into the fingers of his gloves Yet Catelyn noted that the sellsword stood half a hand taller than his foe with a longer reach… and Bronn was fifteen years younger if she was any judge

They knelt in the grass beneath the weeping woman facing each other with Lannister between them The septon removed a faceted crystal sphere from the soft cloth bag at his waist He lifted it high above his head and the light shattered Rainbows danced across the Imp’s face In a high solemn singsong voice the septon asked the gods to look down and bear witness to find the truth in this man’s soul to grant him life and freedom if he was innocent death if he was guilty His voice echoed off the surrounding towers

When the last echo had died away the septon lowered his crystal and made a hasty departure Tyrion leaned over and whispered something in Bronn’s ear before the guardsmen led him away The sellsword rose laughing and brushed a blade of grass from his knee

Robert Arryn Lord of the Eyrie and Defender of the Vale was fidgeting impatiently in his elevated chair When are they going to fight he asked plaintively

Ser Vardis was helped back to his feet by one of his squires The other brought him a triangular shield almost four feet tall heavy oak dotted with iron studs They strapped it to his left forearm When Lysa’s master-at-arms offered Bronn a similar shield the sellsword spat and waved it away Three days growth of coarse black beard covered his jaw and cheeks but if he did not shave it was not for want of a razor the edge of his sword had the dangerous glimmer of steel that had been honed every day for hours until it was too sharp to touch

Ser Vardis held out a gauntleted hand and his squire placed a handsome double-edged longsword in his grasp The blade was engraved with a delicate silver tracery of a mountain sky its pommel was a falcon’s head its crossguard fashioned into the shape of wings I had that sword crafted for Jon in King’s Landing Lysa told her guests proudly as they watched Ser Vardis try a practice cut He wore it whenever he sat the Iron Throne in King Robert’s place Isn’t it a lovely thing I thought it only fitting that our champion avenge Jon with his own blade

The engraved silver blade was beautiful beyond a doubt but it seemed to Catelyn that Ser Vardis might have been more comfortable with his own sword Yet she said nothing she was weary of futile arguments with her sister

Make them fight Lord Robert called out

Ser Vardis faced the Lord of the Eyrie and lifted his sword in salute For the Eyrie and the Vale

Tyrion Lannister had been seated on a balcony across the garden flanked by his guards It was to him that Bronn turned with a cursory salute

They await your command Lady Lysa said to her lord son

Fight the boy screamed his arms trembling as they clutched at his chair

Ser Vardis swiveled bringing up his heavy shield Bronn turned to face him Their swords rang together once twice a testing The sellsword backed off a step The knight came after holding his shield before him He tried a slash but Bronn jerked back just out of reach and the silver blade cut only air Bronn circled to his right Ser Vardis turned to follow keeping his shield between them The knight pressed forward placing each foot carefully on the uneven ground The sellsword gave way a faint smile playing over his lips Ser Vardis attacked slashing but Bronn leapt away from him hopping lightly over a low moss-covered stone Now the sellsword circled left away from the shield toward the knight’s unprotected side Ser Vardis tried a hack at his legs but he did not have the reach Bronn danced farther to his left Ser Vardis turned in place

The man is craven Lord Hunter declared Stand and fight coward Other voices echoed the sentiment

Catelyn looked to Ser Rodrik Her master-at-arms gave a curt shake of his head He wants to make Ser Vardis chase him The weight of armor and shield will tire even the strongest man

She had seen men practice at their swordplay near every day of her life had viewed half a hundred tourneys in her time but this was something different and deadlier a dance where the smallest misstep meant death And as she watched the memory of another duel in another time came back to Catelyn Stark as vivid as if it had been yesterday

They met in the lower bailey of Riverrun When Brandon saw that Petyr wore only helm and breastplate and mail he took off most of his armor Petyr had begged her for a favor he might wear but she had turned him away Her lord father promised her to Brandon Stark and so it was to him that she gave her token a pale blue handscarf she had embroidered with the leaping trout of Riverrun As she pressed it into his hand she pleaded with him He is only a foolish boy but I have loved him like a brother It would grieve me to see him die And her betrothed looked at her with the cool grey eyes of a Stark and promised to spare the boy who loved her

That fight was over almost as soon as it began Brandon was a man grown and he drove Littlefinger all the way across the bailey and down the water stair raining steel on him with every step until the boy was staggering and bleeding from a dozen wounds Yield he called more than once but Petyr would only shake his head and fight on grimly When the river was lapping at their ankles Brandon finally ended it with a brutal backhand cut that bit through Petyr’s rings and leather into the soft flesh below the ribs so deep that Catelyn was certain that the wound was mortal He looked at her as he fell and murmured Cat as the bright blood came flowing out between his mailed fingers She thought she had forgotten that

That was the last time she had seen his face… until the day she was brought before him in King’s Landing

A fortnight passed before Littlefinger was strong enough to leave Riverrun but her lord father forbade her to visit him in the tower where he lay abed Lysa helped their maester nurse him she had been softer and shyer in those days Edmure had called on him as well but Petyr had sent him away Her brother had acted as Brandon’s squire at the duel and Littlefinger would not forgive that As soon as he was strong enough to be moved Lord Hoster Tully sent Petyr Baelish away in a closed litter to finish his healing on the Fingers upon the windswept jut of rock where he’d been born

The ringing clash of steel on steel jarred Catelyn back to the present Ser Vardis was coming hard at Bronn driving into him with shield and sword The sellsword scrambled backward checking each blow stepping lithely over rock and root his eyes never leaving his foe He was quicker Catelyn saw the knight’s silvered sword never came near to touching him but his own ugly grey blade hacked a notch from Ser Vardis’s shoulder plate

The brief flurry of fighting ended as swiftly as it had begun when Bronn sidestepped and slid behind the statue of the weeping woman Ser Vardis lunged at where he had been striking a spark off the pale marble of Alyssa’s thigh

They’re not fighting good Mother the Lord of the Eyrie complained I want them to fight

They will sweet baby his mother soothed him The sellsword can’t run all day

Some of the lords on Lysa’s terrace were making wry jests as they refilled their wine cups but across the garden Tyrion Lannister’s mismatched eyes watched the champions dance as if there were nothing else in the world

Bronn came out from behind the statue hard and fast still moving left aiming a two-handed cut at the knight’s unshielded right side Ser Vardis blocked but clumsily and the sellsword’s blade flashed upward at his head Metal rang and a falcon’s wing collapsed with a crunch Ser Vardis took a half step back to brace himself raised his shield Oak chips flew as Bronn’s sword hacked at the wooden wall The sellsword stepped left again away from the shield and caught Ser Vardis across the stomach the razor edge of his blade leaving a bright gash when it bit into the knight’s plate

Ser Vardis drove forward off his back foot his own silver blade descending in a savage arc Bronn slammed it aside and danced away The knight crashed into the weeping woman rocking her on her plinth Staggered he stepped backward his head turning this way and that as he searched for his foe The slit visor of his helm narrowed his vision

Behind you ser Lord Hunter shouted too late Bronn brought his sword down with both hands catching Ser Vardis in the elbow of his sword arm The thin lobstered metal that protected the joint crunched The knight grunted turning wrenching his weapon up This time Bronn stood his ground The swords flew at each other and their steel song filled the garden and rang off the white towers of the Eyrie

Ser Vardis is hurt Ser Rodrik said his voice grave

Catelyn did not need to be told she had eyes she could see the bright finger of blood running along the knight’s forearm the wetness inside the elbow joint Every parry was a little slower and a little lower than the one before Ser Vardis turned his side to his foe trying to use his shield to block instead but Bronn slid around him quick as a cat The sellsword seemed to be getting stronger His cuts were leaving their marks now Deep shiny gashes gleamed all over the knight’s armor on his right thigh his beaked visor crossing on his breastplate a long one along the front of his gorget The moon-and-falcon rondel over Ser Vardis’s right arm was sheared clean in half hanging by its strap They could hear his labored breath rattling through the air holes in his visor

Blind with arrogance as they were even the knights and lords of the Vale could see what was happening below them yet her sister could not Enough Ser Vardis Lady Lysa called down Finish him now my baby is growing tired

And it must be said of Ser Vardis Egen that he was true to his lady’s command even to the last One moment he was reeling backward half-crouched behind his scarred shield the next he charged The sudden bull rush caught Bronn off balance Ser Vardis crashed into him and slammed the lip of his shield into the sellsword’s face Almost almost Bronn lost his feet… he staggered back tripped over a rock and caught hold of the weeping woman to keep his balance Throwing aside his shield Ser Vardis lurched after him using both hands to raise his sword His right arm was blood from elbow to fingers now yet his last desperate blow would have opened Bronn from neck to navel… if the sellsword had stood to receive it

But Bronn jerked back Jon Arryn’s beautiful engraved silver sword glanced off the marble elbow of the weeping woman and snapped clean a third of the way up the blade Bronn put his shoulder into the statue’s back The weathered likeness of Alyssa Arryn tottered and fell with a great crash and Ser Vardis Egen went down beneath her

Bronn was on him in a heartbeat kicking what was left of his shattered rondel aside to expose the weak spot between arm and breastplate Ser Vardis was lying on his side pinned beneath the broken torso of the weeping woman Catelyn heard the knight groan as the sellsword lifted his blade with both hands and drove it down and in with all his weight behind it under the arm and through the ribs Ser Vardis Egen shuddered and lay still

Silence hung over the Eyrie Bronn yanked off his halfhelm and let it fall to the grass His lip was smashed and bloody where the shield had caught him and his coal-black hair was soaked with sweat He spit out a broken tooth

Is it over Mother the Lord of the Eyrie asked

No Catelyn wanted to tell him it’s only now beginning

Yes Lysa said glumly her voice as cold and dead as the captain of her guard
