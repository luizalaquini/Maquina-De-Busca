of each foot  A lilting effect which reaches a peak at each foot
boundary and drops rather faster at the beginning of the foot than it
rises at the end sounds more natural  The magnitude of this inflection
can be altered slightly to add interest but a considerable increase in it
produces a semantic change by making the utterance sound more emphatic
It is a major problem to pin down exactly the turning points of pitch in
the falling-rising and rising-falling contours 4 and 5 in Figure 85
And even deciding on precise values for the pitch frequencies involved is not
always easy
pp
The aim of the pitch assignment method of ISP is to allow the person
or program which originates a spoken message to exercise a great deal
of control over its intonation without having to concern himself with
foot or syllable structure  The message to be spoken must be broken down
into tone groups
which correspond roughly to Hallidays tone groups
Each one comprises a
ul
tonic
of one or more feet which is optionally preceded by a
ul
pretonic
also with a number of feet  It is advantageous to allow a tone group
boundary to occur in the middle of a foot whereas Hallidays scheme
insists that it occurs at a foot boundary
The first foot of the tonic the
ul
tonic foot
is marked by an asterisk at the beginning
It is on the first syllable of this foot em the
tonic or nuclear
syllable em that the major stress of the tone group occurs
If there is no asterisk in a tone group
ISP takes the final foot as the tonic
since this is the most common case
pp
The pitch contour on a tone group is specified by an array of ten numbers
Of course the system cannot generate all conceivable contours for a tone
group but the definitions of the ten specifiable quantities have been
chosen to give a useful range of contours
If necessary more precise control over the pitch of an utterance can
be achieved by making the tone groups smaller
pp
The overall pitch movement is controlled by specifying the pitch at three
places  the beginning of the tone group the beginning of the tonic syllable
and the end of the tone group
Provision is made for an abrupt pitch break at the start of the tonic
syllable in order to simulate tone groups 2 and 3 and to a lesser
extent tone groups 4 and 5
The pitch is interpolated linearly over the first part of the
tone group up to the tonic syllable and over the last part from there to
the end except that it is possible to specify a non-linearity on the tonic
syllable for emphasis as shown in Figure 86
FC Figure 86
pp
On this basic shape are superimposed two finer pitch patterns
One of these is an initialization-continuation option which allows
the pitch to rise or fall independently on the initial and final feet
to specified values without affecting the contour on the rest
of the tone group Figure 87
FC Figure 87
The other is a foot pattern which is superimposed on each pretonic foot
to give the stressed syllables of the pretonic added prominence and avoid
the monotony of constant pitch
This is specified by a
ul
non-linearity
parameter which distorts the contour on the foot at a pre-determined
point along it
Figure 88 shows the effect
