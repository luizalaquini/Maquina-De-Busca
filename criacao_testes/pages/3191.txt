255 While the bridegroom tarried they all slumbered and slept

256 And at midnight there was a cry made Behold the bridegroom
cometh go ye out to meet him

257 Then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps

258 And the foolish said unto the wise Give us of your oil for our
lamps are gone out

259 But the wise answered saying Not so lest there be not enough
for us and you but go ye rather to them that sell and buy for
yourselves

2510 And while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that
were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut

2511 Afterward came also the other virgins saying Lord Lord open
to us

2512 But he answered and said Verily I say unto you I know you not

2513 Watch therefore for ye know neither the day nor the hour
wherein the Son of man cometh

2514 For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far
country who called his own servants and delivered unto them his
goods

2515 And unto one he gave five talents to another two and to
another one to every man according to his several ability and
straightway took his journey

2516 Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with
the same and made them other five talents

2517 And likewise he that had received two he also gained other two

2518 But he that had received one went and digged in the earth and
hid his lords money

2519 After a long time the lord of those servants cometh and
reckoneth with them

2520 And so he that had received five talents came and brought other
five talents saying Lord thou deliveredst unto me five talents
behold I have gained beside them five talents more

2521 His lord said unto him Well done thou good and faithful
servant thou hast been faithful over a few things I will make thee
ruler over many things enter thou into the joy of thy lord

2522 He also that had received two talents came and said Lord thou
deliveredst unto me two talents behold I have gained two other
talents beside them

2523 His lord said unto him Well done good and faithful servant
thou hast been faithful over a few things I will make thee ruler over
many things enter thou into the joy of thy lord

2524 Then he which had received the one talent came and said Lord I
knew thee that thou art an hard man reaping where thou hast not sown
and gathering where thou hast not strawed 2525 And I was afraid and
went and hid thy talent in the earth lo there thou hast that is
thine

2526 His lord answered and said unto him Thou wicked and slothful
servant thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not and gather where
I have not strawed 2527 Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money
to the exchangers and then at my coming I should have received mine
own with usury

2528 Take therefore the talent from him and give it unto him which
hath ten talents

2529 For unto every one that hath shall be given and he shall have
abundance but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that
which he hath

2530 And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness there
shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth

2531 When the Son of man shall come in his glory and all the holy
angels with him then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory 2532
And before him shall be gathered all nations and he shall separate
them one from another as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the
goats 2533 And he shall set the sheep on his right hand but the
goats on the left

2534 Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand Come ye
blessed of my Father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the
foundation of the world 2535 For I was an hungred and ye gave me
meat I was thirsty and ye gave me drink I was a stranger and ye
took me in 2536 Naked and ye clothed me I was sick and ye visited
me I was in prison and ye came unto me

2537 Then shall the righteous answer him saying Lord when saw we
thee an hungred and fed thee or thirsty and gave thee drink  2538
When saw we thee a stranger and took thee in or naked and clothed
thee  2539 Or when saw we thee sick or in prison and came unto
