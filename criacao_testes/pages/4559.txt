Visenya and Rhaenys she recalled I am descended from Aegon and Rhaenys through their son Aenys and their grandson Jaehaerys

Blue lips speak only lies isn’t that what Xaro told you Why do you care what the warlocks whispered All they wanted was to suck the life from you you know that now

Perhaps she said reluctantly Yet the things I saw   

A dead man in the prow of a ship a blue rose a banquet of blood    what does any of it mean Khaleesi A mummer’s dragon you said What is a mummer’s dragon pray

A cloth dragon on poles Dany explained Mummers use them in their follies to give the heroes something to fight

Ser Jorah frowned

Dany could not let it go His is the song of ice and fire my brother said I’m certain it was my brother Not Viserys Rhaegar He had a harp with silver strings

Ser Jorah’s frown deepened until his eyebrows came together Prince Rhaegar played such a harp he conceded You saw him

She nodded There was a woman in a bed with a babe at her breast My brother said the babe was the prince that was promised and told her to name him Aegon

Prince Aegon was Rhaegar’s heir by Elia of Dorne Ser Jorah said But if he was this prince that was promised the promise was broken along with his skull when the Lannisters dashed his head against a wall

I remember Dany said sadly They murdered Rhaegar’s daughter as well the little princess Rhaenys she was named like Aegon’s sister There was no Visenya but he said the dragon has three heads What is the song of ice and fire

It’s no song I’ve ever heard

I went to the warlocks hoping for answers but instead they’ve left me with a hundred new questions

By then there were people in the streets once more Make way Aggo shouted while Jhogo sniffed at the air suspiciously I smell it Khaleesi he called The poison water The Dothraki distrusted the sea and all that moved upon it Water that a horse could not drink was water they wanted no part of They will learn Dany resolved I braved their sea with Khal Drogo Now they can brave mine

Qarth was one of the world’s great ports its great sheltered harbor a riot of color and clangor and strange smells Winesinks warehouses and gaming dens lined the streets cheek by jowl with cheap brothels and the temples of peculiar gods Cutpurses cutthroats spellsellers and moneychangers mingled with every crowd The waterfront was one great marketplace where the buying and selling went on all day and all night and goods might be had for a fraction of what they cost at the bazaar if a man did not ask where they came from Wizened old women bent like hunchbacks sold flavored waters and goat’s milk from glazed ceramic jugs strapped to their shoulders Seamen from half a hundred nations wandered amongst the stalls drinking spiced liquors and trading jokes in queer-sounding tongues The air smelled of salt and frying fish of hot tar and honey of incense and oil and sperm

Aggo gave an urchin a copper for a skewer of honey-roasted mice and nibbled them as he rode Jhogo bought a handful of fat white cherries Elsewhere they saw beautiful bronze daggers for sale dried squids and carved onyx a potent magical elixir made of virgin’s milk and shade of the evening even dragon’s eggs which looked suspiciously like painted rocks

As they passed the long stone quays reserved for the ships of the Thirteen she saw chests of saffron frankincense and pepper being off-loaded from Xaro’s ornate Vermillion Kiss Beside her casks of wine bales of sourleaf and pallets of striped hides were being trundled up the gangplank onto the Bride in Azure to sail on the evening tide Farther along a crowd had gathered around the Spicer galley Sunblaze to bid on slaves It was well known that the cheapest place to buy a slave was right off the ship and the banners floating from her masts proclaimed that the Sunblaze had just arrived from Astapor on Slaver’s Bay

Dany would get no help from the Thirteen the Tourmaline Brotherhood or the Ancient Guild of Spicers She rode her silver past several miles of their quays docks and storehouses all the way out to the far end of the horseshoe-shaped harbor where the ships from the Summer Islands Westeros and the Nine Free Cities were permitted to dock

She dismounted beside a gaming pit where a basilisk was tearing a big red dog to pieces amidst a shouting ring of sailors Aggo Jhogo you will guard the horses while Ser Jorah and I speak to the captains

As you say Khaleesi We will watch you as you go

It was good to hear men speaking Valyrian once more and even the Common Tongue Dany thought as they approached the first ship Sailors dockworkers and merchants alike gave way before her not knowing what to make of this slim young girl with silver-gold hair who dressed in the Dothraki fashion and walked with a knight at her side Despite the heat of the day Ser Jorah wore his green wool surcoat over chainmail the black bear of Mormont sewn on his chest

But neither her beauty nor his size and strength would serve with the men whose ships they needed

You require passage for a hundred Dothraki all their horses yourself and this knight and three dragons said the captain of the great cog Ardent Friend before he walked away laughing When she told a Lyseni on the Trumpeteer that she was Daenerys Stormborn Queen of the Seven Kingdoms he gave her a deadface look and said Aye and I’m Lord Tywin Lannister and shit gold every night The cargomaster of the Myrish galley Silken Spirit opined that dragons were too dangerous at sea where any stray breath of flame might set the rigging afire The owner of Lord Faro’s Belly would risk dragons but not Dothraki I’ll have no such godless savages in my Belly I’ll not The two brothers who captained the sister ships Quicksilver and Greyhound seemed sympathetic and invited them into the cabin for a glass of Arbor red They were so courteous that Dany was hopeful for a time but in the end the price they asked was far beyond her means and might have been beyond Xaro’s Pinchbottom Petto and Sloe-Eyed Maid were too small for her needs Bravo was bound for the Jade Sea and Magister Manolo scarce looked seaworthy

As they made their way toward the next quay Ser Jorah laid a hand against the small of her back Your Grace You are being followed No do not turn He guided her gently toward a brass-seller’s booth This is a noble work my queen he proclaimed loudly lifting a large platter for her inspection See how it shines in the sun

The brass was polished to a high sheen Dany could see her face in it    and when Ser Jorah angled it to the right she could see behind her I see a fat brown man and an older man with a staff Which is it

Both of them Ser Jorah said They have been following us since we left Quicksilver

The ripples in the brass stretched the strangers queerly making one man seem long and gaunt the other immensely squat and broad A most excellent brass great lady the merchant exclaimed Bright as the sun And for the Mother of Dragons only thirty honors

The platter was worth no more than three Where are my guards Dany declared This man is trying to rob me For Jorah she lowered her voice and spoke in the Common Tongue They may not mean me ill Men have looked at women since time began perhaps it is no more than that

The brass-seller ignored their whispers Thirty Did I say thirty Such a fool I am The price is twenty honors

All the brass in this booth is not worth twenty honors Dany told him as she studied the reflections The old man had the look of Westeros about him and the brown-skinned one must weigh twenty stone The Usurper offered a lordship to the man who kills me and these two are far from home Or could they be creatures of the warlocks meant to take me unawares

Ten Khaleesi because you are so lovely Use it for a looking glass Only brass this fine could capture such beauty

It might serve to carry nightsoil If you threw it away I might pick it up so long as I did not need to stoop But pay for it Dany shoved the platter back into his hands Worms have crawled up your nose and eaten your wits

Eight honors he cried My wives will beat me and call me fool but I am a helpless child in your hands Come eight that is less than it is worth

What do I need with dull brass when Xaro Xhoan Daxos feeds me off plates of gold As she turned to walk off Dany let her glance sweep over the strangers The brown man was near as wide as he’d looked in the platter with a gleaming bald head and the smooth cheeks of a eunuch A long curving arakh was thrust through the sweat-stained yellow silk of his bellyband Above the silk he was naked but for an absurdly tiny iron-studded vest Old scars crisscrossed his tree-trunk arms huge chest and massive belly pale against his nut-brown skin

The other man wore a traveler’s cloak of undyed wool the hood thrown back Long white hair fell to his shoulders and a silky white beard covered the lower half of his face He leaned his weight on a hardwood staff as tall as he was Only fools would stare so openly if they meant me harm All the same it might be prudent to head back toward Jhogo and Aggo The old man does not wear a sword she said to Jorah in the Common Tongue as she drew him away

The brass merchant came hopping after them Five honors for five it is yours it was meant for you

Ser Jorah said A hardwood staff can crack a skull as well as any mace

Four I know you want it He danced in front of them scampering backward as he thrust the platter at their faces

Do they follow

Lift that up a little higher the knight told the merchant Yes The old man pretends to linger at a potter’s stall but the brown one has eyes only for you

Two honors Two Two The merchant was panting heavily from the effort of running backward

Pay him before he kills himself Dany told Ser Jorah wondering what she was going to do with a huge brass platter She turned back as he reached for his coins intending to put an end to this mummer’s farce The blood of the dragon would not be herded through the bazaar by an old man and a fat eunuch

A Qartheen stepped into her path Mother of Dragons for you He knelt and thrust a jewel box into her face

Dany took it almost by reflex The box was carved wood its mother-of-pearl lid inlaid with jasper and chalcedony You are too generous She opened it Within was a glittering green scarab carved from onyx and emerald Beautiful she thought This will help pay for our passage As she reached inside the box the man said I am so sorry but she hardly heard

The scarab unfolded with a hiss

Dany caught a glimpse of a malign black face almost human and an arched tail dripping venom    and then the box flew from her hand in pieces turning end over end Sudden pain twisted her fingers As she cried out and clutched her hand the brass merchant let out a shriek a woman screamed and suddenly the Qartheen were shouting and pushing each other aside Ser Jorah slammed past her and Dany stumbled to one knee She heard the hiss again The old man drove the butt of his staff into the ground Aggo came riding through an eggseller’s stall and vaulted from his saddle Jhogo’s whip cracked overhead Ser Jorah slammed the eunuch over the head with the brass platter sailors and whores and merchants were fleeing or shouting or both   

Your Grace a thousand pardons The old man knelt It’s dead Did I break your hand

She closed her fingers wincing I don’t think so

I had to knock it away he started but her bloodriders were on him before he could finish Aggo kicked his staff away and Jhogo seized him round the shoulders forced him to his knees and pressed a dagger to his throat Khaleesi we saw him strike you Would you see the color of his blood

Release him Dany climbed to her feet Look at the bottom of his staff blood of my blood Ser Jorah had been shoved off his feet by the eunuch She ran between them as arakh and longsword both came flashing from their sheaths Put down your steel Stop it
