The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans


11 Paul a servant of Jesus Christ called to be an apostle
separated unto the gospel of God 12 Which he had promised afore by
his prophets in the holy scriptures 13 Concerning his Son Jesus
Christ our Lord which was made of the seed of David according to the
flesh 14 And declared to be the Son of God with power according to
the spirit of holiness by the resurrection from the dead 15 By whom
we have received grace and apostleship for obedience to the faith
among all nations for his name 16 Among whom are ye also the called
of Jesus Christ 17 To all that be in Rome beloved of God called to
be saints Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord
Jesus Christ

18 First I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all that your
faith is spoken of throughout the whole world

19 For God is my witness whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel
of his Son that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my
prayers 110 Making request if by any means now at length I might
have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you

111 For I long to see you that I may impart unto you some spiritual
gift to the end ye may be established 112 That is that I may be
comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me

113 Now I would not have you ignorant brethren that oftentimes I
purposed to come unto you but was let hitherto that I might have
some fruit among you also even as among other Gentiles

114 I am debtor both to the Greeks and to the Barbarians both to
the wise and to the unwise

115 So as much as in me is I am ready to preach the gospel to you
that are at Rome also

116 For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it is the power
of God unto salvation to every one that believeth to the Jew first
and also to the Greek

117 For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to
faith as it is written The just shall live by faith

118 For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all
ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold the truth in
unrighteousness 119 Because that which may be known of God is
manifest in them for God hath shewed it unto them

120 For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world
are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made even
his eternal power and Godhead so that they are without excuse 121
Because that when they knew God they glorified him not as God
neither were thankful but became vain in their imaginations and
their foolish heart was darkened

122 Professing themselves to be wise they became fools 123 And
changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to
corruptible man and to birds and fourfooted beasts and creeping
things

124 Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts
of their own hearts to dishonour their own bodies between themselves
125 Who changed the truth of God into a lie and worshipped and
served the creature more than the Creator who is blessed for ever
Amen

126 For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections for even
their women did change the natural use into that which is against
nature 127 And likewise also the men leaving the natural use of the
woman burned in their lust one toward another men with men working
that which is unseemly and receiving in themselves that recompence of
their error which was meet

128 And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge
God gave them over to a reprobate mind to do those things which are
not convenient 129 Being filled with all unrighteousness
fornication wickedness covetousness maliciousness full of envy
murder debate deceit malignity whisperers 130 Backbiters haters
of God despiteful proud boasters inventors of evil things
disobedient to parents 131 Without understanding covenantbreakers
without natural affection implacable unmerciful 132 Who knowing
the judgment of God that they which commit such things are worthy of
death not only do the same but have pleasure in them that do them

21 Therefore thou art inexcusable O man whosoever thou art that
judgest for wherein thou judgest another thou condemnest thyself
for thou that judgest doest the same things

22 But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth
