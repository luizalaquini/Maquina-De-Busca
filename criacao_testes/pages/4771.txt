Surprisingly Stannis smiled at that You’re bold enough to be a Stark Yes I should have come sooner If not for my Hand I might not have come at all Lord Seaworth is a man of humble birth but he reminded me of my duty when all I could think of was my rights I had the cart before the horse Davos said I was trying to win the throne to save the kingdom when I should have been trying to save the kingdom to win the throne Stannis pointed north There is where I’ll find the foe that I was born to fight

His name may not be spoken Melisandre added softly He is the God of Night and Terror Jon Snow and these shapes in the snow are his creatures

They tell me that you slew one of these walking corpses to save Lord Mormont’s life Stannis said It may be that this is your war as well Lord Snow If you will give me your help

My sword is pledged to the Night’s Watch Your Grace Jon Snow answered carefully

That did not please the king Stannis ground his teeth and said I need more than a sword from you

Jon was lost My lord

I need the north

The north I    my brother Robb was King in the North   

Your brother was the rightful Lord of Winterfell If he had stayed home and done his duty instead of crowning himself and riding off to conquer the riverlands he might be alive today Be that as it may You are not Robb no more than I am Robert

The harsh words had blown away whatever sympathy Jon might have had for Stannis I loved my brother he said

And I mine Yet they were what they were and so are we I am the only true king in Westeros north or south And you are Ned Stark’s bastard Stannis studied him with those dark blue eyes Tywin Lannister has named Roose Bolton his Warden of the North to reward him for betraying your brother The ironmen are fighting amongst themselves since Balon Greyjoy’s death yet they still hold Moat Cailin Deepwood Motte Torrhen’s Square and most of the Stony Shore Your father’s lands are bleeding and I have neither the strength nor the time to stanch the wounds What is needed is a Lord of Winterfell A loyal Lord of Winterfell

He is looking at me Jon thought stunned Winterfell is no more Theon Greyjoy put it to the torch

Granite does not burn easily Stannis said The castle can be rebuilt in time It’s not the walls that make a lord it’s the man Your northmen do not know me have no reason to love me yet I will need their strength in the battles yet to come I need a son of Eddard Stark to win them to my banner

He would make me Lord of Winterfell The wind was gusting and Jon felt so light-headed he was half afraid it would blow him off the Wall Your Grace he said you forget I am a Snow not a Stark

It’s you who are forgetting King Stannis replied

Melisandre put a warm hand on Jon’s arm A king can remove the taint of bastardy with a stroke Lord Snow

Lord Snow Ser Alliser Thorne had named him that to mock his bastard birth Many of his brothers had taken to using it as well some with affection others to wound But suddenly it had a different sound to it in Jon’s ears It sounded    real Yes he said hesitantly kings have legitimized bastards before but    I am still a brother of the Night’s Watch I knelt before a heart tree and swore to hold no lands and father no children

Jon Melisandre was so close he could feel the warmth of her breath R’hllor is the only true god A vow sworn to a tree has no more power than one sworn to your shoes Open your heart and let the light of the Lord come in Burn these weirwoods and accept Winterfell as a gift of the Lord of Light

When Jon had been very young too young to understand what it meant to be a bastard he used to dream that one day Winterfell might be his Later when he was older he had been ashamed of those dreams Winterfell would go to Robb and then his sons or to Bran or Rickon should Robb die childless And after them came Sansa and Arya Even to dream otherwise seemed disloyal as if he were betraying them in his heart wishing for their deaths I never wanted this he thought as he stood before the blue-eyed king and the red woman I loved Robb loved all of them    I never wanted any harm to come to any of them but it did And now there’s only me All he had to do was say the word and he would be Jon Stark and nevermore a Snow All he had to do was pledge this king his fealty and Winterfell was his All he had to do   

   was forswear his vows again

And this time it would not be a ruse To claim his father’s castle he must turn against his father’s gods

King Stannis gazed off north again his gold cloak streaming from his shoulders It may be that I am mistaken in you Jon Snow We both know the things that are said of bastards You may lack your father’s honor or your brother’s skill in arms But you are the weapon the Lord has given me I have found you here as you found the cache of dragonglass beneath the Fist and I mean to make use of you Even Azor Ahai did not win his war alone I killed a thousand wildlings took another thousand captive and scattered the rest but we both know they will return Melisandre has seen that in her fires This Tormund Thunderfist is likely re-forming them even now and planning some new assault And the more we bleed each other the weaker we shall all be when the real enemy falls upon us

Jon had come to that same realization As you say Your Grace He wondered where this king was going

Whilst your brothers have been struggling to decide who shall lead them I have been speaking with this Mance Rayder He ground his teeth A stubborn man that one and prideful He will leave me no choice but to give him to the flames But we took other captives as well other leaders The one who calls himself the Lord of Bones some of their clan chiefs the new Magnar of Thenn Your brothers will not like it no more than your father’s lords but I mean to allow the wildlings through the Wall    those who will swear me their fealty pledge to keep the king’s peace and the king’s laws and take the Lord of Light as their god Even the giants if those great knees of theirs can bend I will settle them on the Gift once I have wrested it away from your new Lord Commander When the cold winds rise we shall live or die together It is time we made alliance against our common foe He looked at Jon Would you agree

My father dreamed of resettling the Gift Jon admitted He and my uncle Benjen used to talk of it He never thought of settling it with wildlings though    but he never rode with wildlings either He did not fool himself the free folk would make for unruly subjects and dangerous neighbors Yet when he weighed Ygritte’s red hair against the cold blue eyes of the wights the choice was easy I agree

Good King Stannis said for the surest way to seal a new alliance is with a marriage I mean to wed my Lord of Winterfell to this wildling princess

Perhaps Jon had ridden with the free folk too long he could not help but laugh Your Grace he said captive or no if you think you can just give Val to me I fear you have a deal to learn about wildling women Whoever weds her had best be prepared to climb in her tower window and carry her off at swordpoint   

Whoever Stannis gave him a measuring look Does this mean you will not wed the girl I warn you she is part of the price you must pay if you want your father’s name and your father’s castle This match is necessary to help assure the loyalty of our new subjects Are you refusing me Jon Snow

No Jon said too quickly It was Winterfell the king was speaking of and Winterfell was not to be lightly refused I mean    this has all come very suddenly Your Grace Might I beg you for some time to consider

As you wish But consider quickly I am not a patient man as your black brothers are about to discover Stannis put a thin fleshless hand on Jon’s shoulder Say nothing of what we’ve discussed here today To anyone But when you return you need only bend your knee lay your sword at my feet and pledge yourself to my service and you shall rise again as Jon Stark the Lord of Winterfell





TYRION

When he heard noises through the thick wooden door of his cell Tyrion Lannister prepared to die

Past time he thought Come on come on make an end to it He pushed himself to his feet His legs were asleep from being folded under him He bent down and rubbed the knives from them I will not go stumbling and waddling to the headsman’s block

He wondered whether they would kill him down here in the dark or drag him through the city so Ser Ilyn Payne could lop his head off After his mummer’s farce of a trial his sweet sister and loving father might prefer to dispose of him quietly rather than risk a public execution I could tell the mob a few choice things if they let me speak But would they be that foolish

As the keys rattled and the door to his cell pushed inward creaking Tyrion pressed back against the dampness of the wall wishing for a weapon I can still bite and kick I’ll die with the taste of blood in my mouth that’s something He wished he’d been able to think of some rousing last words Bugger you all was not like to earn him much of a place in the histories

Torchlight fell across his face He shielded his eyes with a hand Come on are you frightened of a dwarf Do it you son of a poxy whore His voice had grown hoarse from disuse

Is that any way to speak about our lady mother The man moved forward a torch in his left hand This is even more ghastly than my cell at Riverrun though not quite so dank

For a moment Tyrion could not breathe You

Well most of me Jaime was gaunt his hair hacked short I left a hand at Harrenhal Bringing the Brave Companions across the narrow sea was not one of Father’s better notions He lifted his arm and Tyrion saw the stump

A bark of hysterical laughter burst from his lips Oh gods he said Jaime I am so sorry but    gods be good look at the two of us Handless and Noseless the Lannister boys

There were days when my hand smelled so bad I wished I was noseless Jaime lowered the torch so the light bathed his brother’s face An impressive scar

Tyrion turned away from the glare They made me fight a battle without my big brother to protect me

I heard tell you almost burned the city down

A filthy lie I only burned the river Abruptly Tyrion remembered where he was and why Are you here to kill me

Now that’s ungrateful Perhaps I should leave you here to rot if you’re going to be so discourteous

Rotting is not the fate Cersei has in mind for me

Well no if truth be told You’re to be beheaded on the morrow out on the old tourney grounds

Tyrion laughed again Will there be food You’ll have to help me with my last words my wits have been running about like a rat in a root cellar
