She knelt beside the coffin covered her face with her
hands and for a time the room was silent as a tomb
whether from a purely mechanical or from any other
cause when Bathsheba arose it was with a quieted spirit
and a regret for the antagonistic instincts which had
seized upon her just before
In her desire to make atonement she took flowers
from a vase by the window and began laying them
around the dead girls head Bathsheba knew no other
way of showing kindness to persons departed than by
giving them flowers She knew not how long she
remained engaged thus She forgot time life where
she was what she was doing A slamming together of
the coach-house doors in the yard brought her to her+
self again An instant after the front door opened and
closed steps crossed the hall and her husband appeared
at the entrance to the room looking in upon her
He beheld it all by degrees stared in stupefaction at
the scene as if he thought it an illusion raised by some
fiendish

incantation Bathsheba pallid as a corpse on
end gazed back at him in the same wild way
So little are instinctive guesses the fruit of a legitimate
induction that at this moment as he stood with the
door in his hand Troy never once thought of Fanny in
connection with what he saw His first confused idea
was that somebody in the house had died
Weli-what   said Troy blankly
I must go  I must go   said Bathsheba to herself
more than to him She came with a dilated eye towards
the door to push past him
 Whats the matter in Gods name  whos dead 
said Troy
I cannot say let me go out I want air  she
continued
But no stay I insist   He seized her hand and
then volition seemed to leave her and she went off into
a state of passivity He still holding her came up the
room and thus hand in hand Troy and Bathsheba
approached the coffins side
The candle was standing on a bureau close by them
and the light slanted down distinctly enkindling the
cold features of both mother and babe Troy looked
in dropped his wifes hand knowledge of it all came
over him in a lurid sheen and he stood still
So still he remained that he could be imagined to
have left in him no motive power whatever The
clashes of feeling in all directions confounded one
another produced a neutrality and there was motion in
none
Do you know her said Bathsheba in a small
enclosed echo as from the interior of a cell
I do said Troy
Is it she
It is
He had originally stood perfectly erect And now
in the welinigh congealed immobility of his frame
could be discerned an incipient movement as in the
darkest night may be discerned light after a while
He was gradually sinking forwards The lines of his
features softened and dismay modulated to illiimitable
sadness Bathsheba was regarding him from the other
side still with parted lips and distracted eyes

Capacity
for intense feeling is proportionate to the general
intensity of the nature and perhaps in all Fannys
sufferings much greater relatively to her strength there
never was a time she suffered in an absolute sense
what Bathsheba suffered now
What Troy did was to sink upon  his knees with
an indefinable union of remorse and reverence upon
his face and bending over Fanny Robin gently kissed
her as one would kiss an infant asleep to avoid
awakening it
At the sight and sound of that to her unendurable
act Bathsheba sprang towards him All the strong
feelings which had been scattered over her existence
since she knew what feeling was seemed gathered
together into one pulsation now The revulsion from
her indignant mood a little earlier when she had
meditated upon compromised honour forestalment
eclipse in maternity by another was violent and entire
All that was forgotten in the simple and still strong
attachment of wife to husband She had sighed for
her self-completeness then and now she cried aloud
against the severance of the union she had deplored
She flung her arms round Troys neck exclaiming wildly
from the deepest deep of her heart --
 Dont -- dont kiss them  O Frank I cant bear
it-i cant  I love you better than she did kiss me
too Frank -- kiss me  You will Frank kiss me too 
There was something so abnormal and startling in
the childlike pain and simplicity of this appeal from a
woman of Bathshebas calibre and independence that
Troy loosening her tightly clasped arms from his neck
looked at her in bewilderment It was such and unex+
pected revelation of all women being alike at heart even
those so different in their accessories as Fanny and this
