Bathshebas return from a two months visit to her
old aunt at Norcombe afforded the impassioned and
yearning farmer a pretext for inquiring directly after
her -- now possibly in the ninth month of her
widowhood -- and endeavouring to get a notion of her
middle of the haymaking and Boldwood contrived to
I am glad to see you out of doors Lydia he said
She simpered and wondered in her heart why he
I hope Mrs Troy is quite well after her long
the coldest-hearted neighbour could scarcely say less
She is quite well sir
Yes cheerful
Fearful did you say
O no I merely said she was cheerful
Tells you all her affairs
No sir
Some of them
Yes sir
Mrs Troy puts much confidence in you Lydia
and very wisely perhaps
She do sir Ive been with her all through her
troubles and was with her at the time of MrTroys
going and all And if she were to marry again I
expect I should bide with her
She promises that you shali -- quite natural said
the strategic lover throbbing throughout him at the
presumption which Liddys words appeared to warrant
 -- that his darling had thought of re-marriage
No -- -she doesnt promise it exactly I merely
judge on my own account
Yes       yes I understand When she alludes to the
possibility of marrying again you conclude --  -- 
P 394
She never do allude to it sir said Liddy thinking
how very stupid Mr Boldwood was getting
Of course not he returned hastily his hope falling
again  You neednt take quite such long reaches with
your rake Lydia -- short and quick ones are best Well
perhaps as she is absolute mistress again now it is wise
of her to resolve never to give up her freedom
 My mistress did certainly once say though not
seriously that she supposed she might marry again at
the end of seven years from last year if she cared to
risk Mr Troys coming back and claiming her
 Ah six years from the present time Said that she
might She might marry at once in every reasonable
persons opinion whatever the lawyers may say to the
contrary
Have you been to ask them said Liddy innocently
 Not I said Boldwood growing red  Liddy you
neednt stay here a minute later than you wish so Mr
Oak says I am now going on a little farther Good
afternoon
He went away vexed with himself and ashamed of
having for this one time in his life done anything which
could be called underhand Poor Boldwood had no
more skill in finesse than a battering-ram and he was
uneasy with a sense of having made himself to appear
stupid and what was worse mean But he had after
all lighted upon one fact by way of repayment It was
a singularly fresh and fascinating fact and though not
without its sadness it was pertinent and real In little
more than six years from this time Bathsheba might
certainly marry him There was something definite in
that hope for admitting that there might have been no
deep thought in her words to Liddy about marriage
they showed at least her creed on the matter
This pleasant notion was now continually in his mind
Six years were a long time but how much shorter than
never the idea he had for so long been obliged to
endure  Jacob had served twice seven years for
Rachel what were six for such a woman as this  He
tried to like the notion of waiting for her better than
that of winning her at once Boldwood felt his love
to be so deep and strong and eternal that it was pos+

had never yet known its full volume and this
patience in delay would afford him an opportunity of
giving sweet proof on the point He would annihilate
the six years of his life as if they were minutes -- so little
did he value his time on earth beside her love He
would let her see all those six years of intangible ether+
eal courtship how little care he had for anything but as
it bore upon the consummation
Meanwhile the early and the late summer brought
round the week in which Greenhill Fair was held

THE SHEEP FAIR -- TROY TOUCHES HIS WIFES HAND
GREENHILL was the Nijni Novgorod of South
Wessex and the busiest merriest noisiest day of the
whole statute number was the day of the sheep fair
This yearly gathering was upon the summit of a hill
which retained in good preservation the remains of an
ancient earthwork consisting of a huge rampart and
entrenchnaent of an oval form encircling the top of
the hill though somewhat broken down here and there
