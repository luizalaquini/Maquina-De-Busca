How many Ned asked leaning forward As ever Robert had not troubled himself to attend the council session so it fell to his Hand to speak for him

As many as can be gotten Lord Hand

Hire fifty new men Ned told him Lord Baelish will see that you get the coin

I will Littlefinger said

You will You found forty thousand golden dragons for a champion’s purse surely you can scrape together a few coppers to keep the king’s peace Ned turned back to Janos Slynt I will also give you twenty good swords from my own household guard to serve with the Watch until the crowds have left

All thanks Lord Hand Slynt said bowing I promise you they shall be put to good use

When the Commander had taken his leave Eddard Stark turned to the rest of the council The sooner this folly is done with the better I shall like it As if the expense and trouble were not irksome enough all and sundry insisted on salting Ned’s wound by calling it the Hand’s tourney as if he were the cause of it And Robert honestly seemed to think he should feel honored

The realm prospers from such events my lord Grand Maester Pycelle said They bring the great the chance of glory and the lowly a respite from their woes

And put coins in many a pocket Littlefinger added Every inn in the city is full and the whores are walking bowlegged and jingling with each step

Lord Renly laughed We’re fortunate my brother Stannis is not with us Remember the time he proposed to outlaw brothels The king asked him if perhaps he’d like to outlaw eating shitting and breathing while he was at it If truth be told I ofttimes wonder how Stannis ever got that ugly daughter of his He goes to his marriage bed like a man marching to a battlefield with a grim look in his eyes and a determination to do his duty

Ned had not joined the laughter I wonder about your brother Stannis as well I wonder when he intends to end his visit to Dragonstone and resume his seat on this council

No doubt as soon as we’ve scourged all those whores into the sea Littlefinger replied provoking more laughter

I have heard quite enough about whores for one day Ned said rising Until the morrow

Harwin had the door when Ned returned to the Tower of the Hand Summon Jory to my chambers and tell your father to saddle my horse Ned told him too brusquely

As you say my lord

The Red Keep and the Hand’s tourney were chafing him raw Ned reflected as he climbed He yearned for the comfort of Catelyn’s arms for the sounds of Robb and Jon crossing swords in the practice yard for the cool days and cold nights of the north

In his chambers he stripped off his council silks and sat for a moment with the book while he waited for Jory to arrive The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms With Descliptions of Many High Lords and Noble Ladies and Their Children by Grand Maester Malleon Pycelle had spoken truly it made for ponderous reading Yet Jon Arryn had asked for it and Ned felt certain he had reasons There was something here some truth buried in these brittle yellow pages if only he could see it But what The tome was over a century old Scarcely a man now alive had yet been born when Malleon had compiled his dusty lists of weddings births and deaths

He opened to the section on House Lannister once more and turned the pages slowly hoping against hope that something would leap out at him The Lannisters were an old family tracing their descent back to Lann the Clever a trickster from the Age of Heroes who was no doubt as legendary as Bran the Builder though far more beloved of singers and taletellers In the songs Lann was the fellow who winkled the Casterlys out of Casterly Rock with no weapon but his wits and stole gold from the sun to brighten his curly hair Ned wished he were here now to winkle the truth out of this damnable book

A sharp rap on the door heralded Jory Cassel Ned closed Malleon’s tome and bid him enter I’ve promised the City Watch twenty of my guard until the tourney is done he told him I rely on you to make the choice Give Alyn the command and make certain the men understand that they are needed to stop fights not start them Rising Ned opened a cedar chest and removed a light linen undertunic Did you find the stableboy

The watchman my lord Jory said He vows he’ll never touch another horse

What did he have to say

He claims he knew Lord Arryn well Fast friends they were Jory snorted The Hand always gave the lads a copper on their name days he says Had a way with horses Never rode his mounts too hard and brought them carrots and apples so they were always pleased to see him

Carrots and apples Ned repeated It sounded as if this boy would be even less use than the others And he was the last of the four Littlefinger had turned up Jory had spoken to each of them in turn Ser Hugh had been brusque and uninformative and arrogant as only a new-made knight can be If the Hand wished to talk to him he should be pleased to receive him but he would not be questioned by a mere captain of guards… even if said captain was ten years older and a hundred times the swordsman The serving girl had at least been pleasant She said Lord Jon had been reading more than was good for him that he was troubled and melancholy over his young son’s frailty and gruff with his lady wife The potboy now cordwainer had never exchanged so much as a word with Lord Jon but he was full of oddments of kitchen gossip the lord had been quarreling with the king the lord only picked at his food the lord was sending his boy to be fostered on Dragonstone the lord had taken a great interest in the breeding of hunting hounds the lord had visited a master armorer to commission a new suit of plate wrought all in pale silver with a blue jasper falcon and a mother-of-pearl moon on the breast The king’s own brother had gone with him to help choose the design the potboy said No not Lord Renly the other one Lord Stannis

Did our watchman recall anything else of note

The lad swears Lord Jon was as strong as a man half his age Often went riding with Lord Stannis he says

Stannis again Ned thought He found that curious Jon Arryn and he had been cordial but never friendly And while Robert had been riding north to Winterfell Stannis had removed himself to Dragonstone the Targaryen island fastness he had conquered in his brother’s name He had given no word as to when he might return Where did they go on these rides Ned asked

The boy says that they visited a brothel

A brothel Ned said The Lord of the Eyrie and Hand of the King visited a brothel with Stannis Baratheon He shook his head incredulous wondering what Lord Renly would make of this tidbit Robert’s lusts were the subject of ribald drinking songs throughout the realm but Stannis was a different sort of man a bare year younger than the king yet utterly unlike him stern humorless unforgiving grim in his sense of duty

The boy insists it’s true The Hand took three guardsmen with him and the boy says they were joking of it when he took their horses afterward

Which brothel Ned asked

The boy did not know The guards would

A pity Lysa carried them off to the Vale Ned said dryly The gods are doing their best to vex us Lady Lysa Maester Colemon Lord Stannis… everyone who might actually know the truth of what happened to Jon Arryn is a thousand leagues away

Will you summon Lord Stannis back from Dragonstone

Not yet Ned said Not until I have a better notion of what this is all about and where he stands The matter nagged at him Why did Stannis leave Had he played some part in Jon Arryn’s murder Or was he afraid Ned found it hard to imagine what could frighten Stannis Baratheon who had once held Storm’s End through a year of siege surviving on rats and boot leather while the Lords Tyrell and Redwyne sat outside with their hosts banqueting in sight of his walls

Bring me my doublet if you would The grey with the direwolf sigil I want this armorer to know who I am It might make him more forthcoming

Jory went to the wardrobe Lord Renly is brother to Lord Stannis as well as the king

Yet it seems that he was not invited on these rides Ned was not sure what to make of Renly with all his friendly ways and easy smiles A few days past he had taken Ned aside to show him an exquisite rose gold locklet Inside was a miniature painted in the vivid Myrish style of a lovely young girl with doe’s eyes and a cascade of soft brown hair Renly had seemed anxious to know if the girl reminded him of anyone and when Ned had no answer but a shrug he had seemed disappointed The maid was Loras Tyrell’s sister Margaery he’d confessed but there were those who said she looked like Lyanna No Ned had told him bemused Could it be that Lord Renly who looked so like a young Robert had conceived a passion for a girl he fancied to be a young Lyanna That struck him as more than passing queer

Jory held out the doublet and Ned slid his hands through the armholes Perhaps Lord Stannis will return for Robert’s tourney he said as Jory laced the garment up the back

That would be a stroke of fortune my lord Jory said

Ned buckled on a longsword In other words not bloody likely His smile was grim

Jory draped Ned’s cloak across his shoulders and clasped it at the throat with the Hand’s badge of office The armorer lives above his shop in a large house at the top of the Street of Steel Alyn knows the way my lord

Ned nodded The gods help this potboy if he’s sent me off haring after shadows It was a slim enough staff to lean on but the Jon Arryn that Ned Stark had known was not one to wear jeweled and silvered plate Steel was steel it was meant for protection not ornament He might have changed his views to be sure He would scarcely have been the first man who came to look on things differently after a few years at court… but the change was marked enough to make Ned wonder

Is there any other service I might perform

I suppose you’d best begin visiting whorehouses

Hard duty my lord Jory grinned The men will be glad to help Porther has made a fair start already

Ned’s favorite horse was saddled and waiting in the yard Varly and Jacks fell in beside him as he rode through the yard Their steel caps and shirts of mail must have been sweltering yet they said no word of complaint As Lord Eddard passed beneath the King’s Gate into the stink of the city his grey and white cloak streaming from his shoulders he saw eyes everywhere and kicked his mount into a trot His guard followed

He looked behind him frequently as they made their way through the crowded city streets Tomard and Desmond had left the castle early this morning to take up positions on the route they must take and watch for anyone following them but even so Ned was uncertain The shadow of the King’s Spider and his little birds had him fretting like a maiden on her wedding night

The Street of Steel began at the market square beside the River Gate as it was named on maps or the Mud Gate as it was commonly called A mummer on stilts was striding through the throngs like some great insect with a horde of barefoot children trailing behind him hooting Elsewhere two ragged boys no older than Bran were dueling with sticks to the loud encouragement of some and the furious curses of others An old woman ended the contest by leaning out of her window and emptying a bucket of slops on the heads of the combatants In the shadow of the wall farmers stood beside their wagons bellowing out Apples the best apples cheap at twice the price and Blood melons sweet as honey and Turnips onions roots here you go here here you go turnips onions roots here you go here

The Mud Gate was open and a squad of City Watchmen stood under the portcullis in their golden cloaks leaning on spears When a column of riders appeared from the west the guardsmen sprang into action shouting commands and moving the carts and foot traffic aside to let the knight enter with his escort The first rider through the gate carried a long black banner The silk rippled in the wind like a living thing across the fabric was blazoned a night sky slashed with purple lightning Make way for Lord Beric the rider shouted Make way for Lord Beric And close behind came the young lord himself a dashing figure on a black courser with red-gold hair and a black satin cloak dusted with stars Here to fight in the Hand’s tourney my lord a guardsman called out to him Here to win the Hand’s tourney Lord Beric shouted back as the crowd cheered

Ned turned off the square where the Street of Steel began and followed its winding path up a long hill past blacksmiths working at open forges freeriders haggling over mail shirts and grizzled ironmongers selling old blades and razors from their wagons The farther they climbed the larger the buildings grew The man they wanted was all the way at the top of the hill in a huge house of timber and plaster whose upper stories loomed over the narrow street The double doors showed a hunting scene carved in ebony and weirwood A pair of stone knights stood sentry at the entrance armored in fanciful suits of polished red steel that transformed them into griffin and unicorn Ned left his horse with Jacks and shouldered his way inside
