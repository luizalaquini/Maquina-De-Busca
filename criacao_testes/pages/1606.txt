So wasteful so unnecessary Anyone could see the
game was over by that point In fact I was just about to
issue an official surrender when they released those
parachutes His eyes are glued on me unblinking so as
not to miss a second of my reaction But what hes said
makes no sense When they released the parachutes
Well you really didnt think I gave the order did you
Forget the obvious fact that if Id had a working hovercraft at
my disposal Id have been using it to make an escape But
that aside what purpose could it have served We both
know Im not above killing children but Im not wasteful I
take life for very specific reasons And there was no reason
for me to destroy a pen full of Capitol children None at all
I wonder if the next fit of coughing is staged so that I
can have time to absorb his words Hes lying Of course
hes lying But theres something struggling to free itself
from the lie as well
However I must concede it was a masterful move on
Coins part The idea that I was bombing our own helpless
children instantly snapped whatever frail allegiance my
people still felt to me There was no real resistance after
that Did you know it aired live You can see Plutarchs
hand there And in the parachutes Well its that sort of
thinking that you look for in a Head Gamemaker isnt it
Snow dabs the corners of his mouth Im sure he wasnt
gunning for your sister but these things happen
Im not with Snow now Im in Special Weaponry back
in 13 with Gale and Beetee Looking at the designs based
on Gales traps That played on human sympathies The
first bomb killed the victims The second the rescuers
Remembering Gales words
Beetee and I have been following the same rule
book President Snow used when he hijacked Peeta
My failure says Snow was being so slow to grasp
Coins plan To let the Capitol and districts destroy one
another and then step in to take power with Thirteen barely
scratched Make no mistake she was intending to take my
place right from the beginning I shouldnt be surprised
After all it was Thirteen that started the rebellion that led to
the Dark Days and then abandoned the rest of the districts
when the tide turned against it But I wasnt watching Coin I
was watching you Mockingjay And you were watching me
Im afraid we have both been played for fools
I refuse for this to be true Some things even I cant
survive I utter my first words since my sisters death I dont
believe you
Snow shakes his head in mock disappointment Oh
my dear Miss Everdeen I thought we had agreed not to lie
to each other
26
Out in the hall I find Paylor standing in exactly the
same spot Did you find what you were looking for she
asks
I hold up the white bud in answer and then stumble
past her I must have made it back to my room because
the next thing I know Im filling a glass with water from the
bathroom faucet and sticking the rose in it I sink to my
knees on the cold tile and squint at the flower as the
whiteness seems hard to focus on in the stark fluorescent
light My finger catches the inside of my bracelet twisting it
like a tourniquet hurting my wrist Im hoping the pain will
help me hang on to reality the way it did for Peeta I must
hang on I must know the truth about what has happened
There are two possibilities although the details
associated with them may vary First as Ive believed that
the Capitol sent in that hovercraft dropped the parachutes
and sacrificed its childrens lives knowing the recently
arrived rebels would go to their aid Theres evidence to
support this The Capitols seal on the hovercraft the lack of
any attempt to blow the enemy out of the sky and their long
history of using children as pawns in their battle against the
districts Then theres Snows account That a Capitol
hovercraft manned by rebels bombed the children to bring
a speedy end to the war But if this was the case why didnt
the Capitol fire on the enemy Did the element of surprise
throw them Had they no defenses left Children are
precious to 13 or so it has always seemed Well not me
maybe Once I had outlived my usefulness I was
expendable Although I think its been a long time since Ive
been considered a child in this war And why would they do
it knowing their own medics would likely respond and be
taken out by the second blast They wouldnt They couldnt
Snows lying Manipulating me as he always has Hoping to
turn me against the rebels and possibly destroy them Yes
Of course
Then whats nagging at me Those double-exploding
bombs for one Its not that the Capitol couldnt have the
same weapon its just that Im sure the rebels did Gale and
Beetees brainchild Then theres the fact that Snow made
no escape attempt when I know him to be the consummate
survivor It seems hard to believe he didnt have a retreat
somewhere some bunker stocked with provisions where
he could live out the rest of his snaky little life And finally
theres his assessment of Coin Whats irrefutable is that
shes done exactly what he said Let the Capitol and the
districts run one another into the ground and then sauntered
in to take power Even if that was her plan it doesnt mean
she dropped those parachutes Victory was already in her
grasp Everything was in her grasp
Except me
