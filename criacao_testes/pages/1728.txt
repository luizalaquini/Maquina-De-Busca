Frank  
 O yes -- of course

My dear Fan no  The bugle has sounded the
barrack gates are closed and I have no leave We are
all of us as good as in the county gaol till to-morrow

 Then I shant see you till then   The words- were
in a faltering tone of disappointment
 How did you get here from Weatherbury  
I walked -- some part of the way -- the rest by the
carriers
 I am surprised
 Yes -- so am I And Frank when will it be  
 What  
 That you promised

to the earth It makes me say what ought to be said
first by you
 Never mind -- say it

clothes

to the Barracks There are bad women about and they
think me one
Quiteso Ill come to you my dean Good-night
Good-night Frank -- good-night
And the noise was again heard of a window closing
The little spot moved away When she passed the
corner a subdued exclamation was heard inside the
wall
Ho -- ho -- Sergeant -- ho -- ho An expostulation
followed but it was indistinct and it became lost amid
a low peal of laughter which was hardly distinguishable
from the gurgle of the tiny whirlpools outside

FARMERS -- A RULE -- IN EXCEPTION
THE first public evidence of Bathshebas decision to
be a farmer in her own person and by proxy no more
was her appearance the following market-day in the
cornmarket at Casterbridge
The low though extensive hall supported by beams
and pillars and latterly dignified by-the name of Corn Ex+
change was thronged with hot men who talked among
each other in twos and threes the speaker of the minute
looking sideways into his auditors face and concentrating
his argument by a contraction of one eyelid during de+
livery The greater number carried in their hands
ground-ash saplings using them partly as walking-sticks
and partly for poking up pigs sheep neighbours with
their backs turned and restful things in general which
seemed to require such treatment in the course of their
peregrinations During conversations each subjected
his sapling to great varieties of usage -- bending it round
his back forming anarch of it between his two hands
overweighting it on the ground till it reached nearly a
semicircle or perhaps it was hastily tucked under the
arm whilst the sample-bag was pulled forth and a hand+
ful of corn poured into the palm which after criticism
was flung upon the floor an issue of events perfectly
well known to half-a-dozen acute town-bred fowls which
had as usual crept into the building unobserved and
waited the fulfilment of their anticipations with a high+
stretched neck and oblique eye
