They’ll do you worse Lord Bolton is giving Harrenhal to the Bloody Mummers he told me so

Gendry pushed black hair out of his eyes So

She looked right at him fearless So when Vargo Hoat’s the lord he’s going to cut off the feet of all the servants to keep them from running away The smiths too

That’s only a story he said scornfully

No it’s true I heard Lord Vargo say so she lied He’s going to cut one foot off everyone The left one Go to the kitchens and wake Hot Pie he’ll do what you say We’ll need bread or oakcakes or something You get the swords and I’ll do the horses We’ll meet near the postern in the east wall behind the Tower of Ghosts No one ever comes there

I know that gate It’s guarded same as the rest

So You won’t forget the swords

I never said I’d come

No But if you do you won’t forget the swords

He frowned No he said at last I guess I won’t

Arya reentered Kingspyre the same way she had left it and stole up the winding steps listening for footfalls In her cell she stripped to the skin and dressed herself carefully in two layers of smallclothes warm stockings and her cleanest tunic It was Lord Bolton’s livery On the breast was sewn his sigil the flayed man of the Dreadfort She tied her shoes threw a wool cloak over her skinny shoulders and knotted it under her throat Quiet as a shadow she moved back down the stairs Outside the lord’s solar she paused to listen at the door easing it open slowly when she heard only silence

The sheepskin map was on the table beside the remains of Lord Bolton’s supper She rolled it up tight and thrust it through her belt He’d left his dagger on the table as well so she took that too just in case Gendry lost his courage

A horse neighed softly as she slipped into the darkened stables The grooms were all asleep She prodded one with her toe until he sat up groggily and said Eh Whas

Lord Bolton requires three horses saddled and bridled

The boy got to his feet pushing straw from his hair Wha at this hour Horses you say He blinked at the sigil on her tunic Whas he want horses for in the dark

Lord Bolton is not in the habit of being questioned by servants She crossed her arms

The stableboy was still looking at the flayed man He knew what it meant Three you say

One two three Hunting horses Fast and surefoot Arya helped him with the bridles and saddles so he would not need to wake any of the others She hoped they would not hurt him afterward but she knew they probably would

Leading the horses across the castle was the worst part She stayed in the shadow of the curtain wall whenever she could so the sentries walking their rounds on the ramparts above would have needed to look almost straight down to see her And if they do what of it I’m my lord’s own cupbearer It was a chill dank autumn night Clouds were blowing in from the west hiding the stars and the Wailing Tower screamed mournfully at every gust of wind It smells like rain Arya did not know whether that would be good or bad for their escape

No one saw her and she saw no one only a grey and white cat creeping along atop the godswood wall It stopped and spit at her waking memories of the Red Keep and her father and Syrio Forel I could catch you if I wanted she called to it softly but I have to go cat The cat hissed again and ran off

The Tower of Ghosts was the most ruinous of Harrenhal’s five immense towers It stood dark and desolate behind the remains of a collapsed sept where only rats had come to pray for near three hundred years It was there she waited to see if Gendry and Hot Pie would come It seemed as though she waited a long time The horses nibbled at the weeds that grew up between the broken stones while the clouds swallowed the last of the stars Arya took out the dagger and sharpened it to keep her hands busy Long smooth strokes the way Syrio had taught her The sound calmed her

She heard them coming long before she saw them Hot Pie was breathing heavily and once he stumbled in the dark barked his shin and cursed loud enough to wake half of Harrenhal Gendry was quieter but the swords he was carrying rang together as he moved Here I am She stood Be quiet or they’ll hear you

The boys picked their way toward her over tumbled stones Gendry was wearing oiled chainmail under his cloak she saw and he had his blacksmith’s hammer slung across his back Hot Pie’s red round face peered out from under a hood He had a sack of bread dangling from his right hand and a big wheel of cheese under his left arm There’s a guard on that postern said Gendry quietly I told you there would be

You stay here with the horses said Arya I’ll get rid of him Come quick when I call

Gendry nodded Hot Pie said Hoot like an owl when you want us to come

I’m not an owl said Arya I’m a wolf I’ll howl

Alone she slid through the shadow of the Tower of Ghosts She walked fast to keep ahead of her fear and it felt as though Syrio Forel walked beside her and Yoren and Jaqen H’ghar and Jon Snow She had not taken the sword Gendry had brought her not yet For this the dagger would be better It was good and sharp This postern was the least of Harrenhal’s gates a narrow door of stout oak studded with iron nails set in an angle of the wall beneath a defensive tower Only one man was set to guard it but she knew there would be sentries up in that tower as well and others nearby walking the walls Whatever happened she must be quiet as a shadow He must not call out A few scattered raindrops had begun to fall She felt one land on her brow and run slowly down her nose

She made no effort to hide but approached the guard openly as if Lord Bolton himself had sent her He watched her come curious as to what might bring a page here at this black hour When she got closer she saw that he was a northman very tall and thin huddled in a ragged fur cloak That was bad She might have been able to trick a Frey or one of the Brave Companions but the Dreadfort men had served Roose Bolton their whole life and they knew him better than she did If I tell him I am Arya Stark and command him to stand aside    No she dare not He was a northman but not a Winterfell man He belonged to Roose Bolton

When she reached him she pushed back her cloak so he would see the flayed man on her breast Lord Bolton sent me

At this hour Why for

She could see the gleam of steel under the fur and she did not know if she was strong enough to drive the point of the dagger through chainmail His throat it must be his throat but he’s too tall I’ll never reach it For a moment she did not know what to say For a moment she was a little girl again and scared and the rain on her face felt like tears

He told me to give all his guards a silver piece for their good service The words seemed to come out of nowhere

Silver you say He did not believe her but he wanted to silver was silver after all Give it over then

Her fingers dug down beneath her tunic and came out clutching the coin Jaqen had given her In the dark the iron could pass for tarnished silver She held it out    and let it slip through her fingers

Cursing her softly the man went to a knee to grope for the coin in the dirt and there was his neck right in front of her Arya slid her dagger out and drew it across his throat as smooth as summer silk His blood covered her hands in a hot gush and he tried to shout but there was blood in his mouth as well

Valar morghulis she whispered as he died

When he stopped moving she picked up the coin Outside the walls of Harrenhal a wolf howled long and loud She lifted the bar set it aside and pulled open the heavy oak door By the time Hot Pie and Gendry came up with the horses the rain was falling hard You killed him Hot Pie gasped

What did you think I would do Her fingers were sticky with blood and the smell was making her mare skittish It’s no matter she thought swinging up into the saddle The rain will wash them clean again





SANSA

The throne room was a sea of jewels furs and bright fabrics Lords and ladies filled the back of the hall and stood beneath the high windows jostling like fishwives on a dock

The denizens of Joffrey’s court had striven to outdo each other today Jalabhar Xho was all in feathers a plumage so fantastic and extravagant that he seemed like to take flight The High Septon’s crystal crown fired rainbows through the air every time he moved his head At the council table Queen Cersei shimmered in a cloth-of-gold gown slashed in burgundy velvet while beside her Varys fussed and simpered in a lilac brocade Moon Boy and Ser Dontos wore new suits of motley clean as a spring morning Even Lady Tanda and her daughters looked pretty in matching gowns of turquoise silk and vair and Lord Gyles was coughing into a square of scarlet silk trimmed with golden lace King Joffrey sat above them all amongst the blades and barbs of the Iron Throne He was in crimson samite his black mantle studded with rubies on his head his heavy golden crown

Squirming through a press of knights squires and rich townfolk Sansa reached the front of the gallery just as a blast of trumpets announced the entry of Lord Tywin Lannister

He rode his warhorse down the length of the hall and dismounted before the Iron Throne Sansa had never seen such armor all burnished red steel inlaid with golden scrollwork and ornamentation His rondels were sunbursts the roaring lion that crowned his helm had ruby eyes and a lioness on each shoulder fastened a cloth-of-gold cloak so long and heavy that it draped the hindquarters of his charger Even the horse’s armor was gilded and his bardings were shimmering crimson silk emblazoned with the lion of Lannister

The Lord of Casterly Rock made such an impressive figure that it was a shock when his destrier dropped a load of dung right at the base of the throne Joffrey had to step gingerly around it as he descended to embrace his grandfather and proclaim him Savior of the City Sansa covered her mouth to hide a nervous smile

Joff made a show of asking his grandfather to assume governance of the realm and Lord Tywin solemnly accepted the responsibility until Your Grace does come of age Then squires removed his armor and Joff fastened the Hand’s chain of office around his neck Lord Tywin took a seat at the council table beside the queen After the destrier was led off and his homage removed Cersei nodded for the ceremonies to continue

A fanfare of brazen trumpets greeted each of the heroes as he stepped between the great oaken doors Heralds cried his name and deeds for all to hear and the noble knights and highborn ladies cheered as lustily as cutthroats at a cockfight Pride of place was given to Mace Tyrell the Lord of Highgarden a once-powerful man gone to fat yet still handsome His sons followed him in Ser Loras and his older brother Ser Garlan the Gallant The three dressed alike in green velvet trimmed with sable

The king descended the throne once more to greet them a great honor He fastened about the throat of each a chain of roses wrought in soft yellow gold from which hung a golden disc with the lion of Lannister picked out in rubies The roses support the lion as the might of Highgarden supports the realm proclaimed Joffrey If there is any boon you would ask of me ask and it shall be yours

And now it comes thought Sansa
