Two are open Jojen pointed One two

I only have two

You have three The crow gave you the third but you will not open it He had a slow soft way of speaking With two eyes you see my face With three you could see my heart With two you can see that oak tree there With three you could see the acorn the oak grew from and the stump that it will one day become With two you see no farther than your walls With three you would gaze south to the Summer Sea and north beyond the Wall

Summer got to his feet I don’t need to see so far Bran made a nervous smile I’m tired of talking about crows Let’s talk about wolves Or lizard-lions Have you ever hunted one Meera We don’t have them here

Meera plucked her frog spear out of the bushes They live in the water In slow streams and deep swamps—

Her brother interrupted Did you dream of a lizard-lion

No said Bran I told you I don’t want—

Did you dream of a wolf

He was making Bran angry I don’t have to tell you my dreams I’m the prince I’m the Stark in Winterfell

Was it Summer

You be quiet

The night of the harvest feast you dreamed you were Summer in the godswood didn’t you

Stop it Bran shouted Summer slid toward the weirwood his white teeth bared

Jojen Reed took no mind When I touched Summer I felt you in him Just as you are in him now

You couldn’t have I was in bed I was sleeping

You were in the godswood all in grey

It was only a bad dream   

Jojen stood I felt you I felt you fall Is that what scares you the falling

The falling Bran thought and the golden man the queen’s brother he scares me too but mostly the falling He did not say it though How could he He had not been able to tell Ser Rodrik or Maester Luwin and he could not tell the Reeds either If he didn’t talk about it maybe he would forget He had never wanted to remember It might not even be a true remembering

Do you fall every night Bran Jojen asked quietly

A low rumbling growl rose from Summer’s throat and there was no play in it He stalked forward all teeth and hot eyes Meera stepped between the wolf and her brother spear in hand Keep him back Bran

Jojen is making him angry

Meera shook out her net

It’s your anger Bran her brother said Your fear

It isn’t I’m not a wolf Yet he’d howled with them in the night and tasted blood in his wolf dreams

Part of you is Summer and part of Summer is you You know that Bran

Summer rushed forward but Meera blocked him jabbing with the three-pronged spear The wolf twisted aside circling stalking Meera turned to face him Call him back Bran

Summer Bran shouted To me Summer He slapped an open palm down on the meat of his thigh His hand tingled though his dead leg felt nothing

The direwolf lunged again and again Meera’s spear darted out Summer dodged circled back The bushes rustled and a lean black shape came padding from behind the weirwood teeth bared The scent was strong his brother had smelled his rage Bran felt hairs rise on the back of his neck Meera stood beside her brother with wolves to either side Bran call them off

I can’t

Jojen up the tree

There’s no need Today is not the day I die

Do it she screamed and her brother scrambled up the trunk of the weirwood using the face for his handholds The direwolves closed Meera abandoned spear and net jumped up and grabbed the branch above her head Shaggy’s jaws snapped shut beneath her ankle as she swung up and over the limb Summer sat back on his haunches and howled while Shaggydog worried the net shaking it in his teeth

Only then did Bran remember that they were not alone He cupped hands around his mouth Hodor he shouted Hodor Hodor He was badly frightened and somehow ashamed They won’t hurt Hodor he assured his treed friends

A few moments passed before they heard a tuneless humming Hodor arrived half-dressed and mud-spattered from his visit to the hot pools but Bran had never been so glad to see him Hodor help me Chase off the wolves Chase them off

Hodor went to it gleefully waving his arms and stamping his huge feet shouting Hodor Hodor running first at one wolf and then the other Shaggydog was the first to flee slinking back into the foliage with a final snarl When Summer had enough he came back to Bran and lay down beside him

No sooner did Meera touch ground than she snatched up her spear and net again Jojen never took his eyes off Summer We will talk again he promised Bran

It was the wolves it wasn’t me He did not understand why they’d gotten so wild Maybe Maester Luwin was right to lock them in the godswood Hodor he said bring me to Maester Luwin

The maester’s turret below the rookery was one of Bran’s favorite places Luwin was hopelessly untidy but his clutter of books and scrolls and bottles was as familiar and comforting to Bran as his bald spot and the flapping sleeves of his loose grey robes He liked the ravens too

He found Luwin perched on a high stool writing With Ser Rodrik gone all of the governance of the castle had fallen on his shoulders My prince he said when Hodor entered you’re early for lessons today The maester spent several hours every afternoon tutoring Bran Rickon and the Walder Freys

Hodor stand still Bran grasped a wall sconce with both hands and used it to pull himself up and out of the basket He hung for a moment by his arms until Hodor carried him to a chair Meera says her brother has the greensight

Maester Luwin scratched at the side of his nose with his writing quill Does she now

He nodded You told me that the children of the forest had the greensight I remember

Some claimed to have that power Their wise men were called greenseers

Was it magic

Call it that for want of a better word if you must At heart it was only a different sort of knowledge

What was it

Luwin set down his quill No one truly knows Bran The children are gone from the world and their wisdom with them It had to do with the faces in the trees we think The First Men believed that the greenseers could see through the eyes of the weirwoods That was why they cut down the trees whenever they warred upon the children Supposedly the greenseers also had power over the beasts of the wood and the birds in the trees Even fish Does the Reed boy claim such powers

No I don’t think But he has dreams that come true sometimes Meera says

All of us have dreams that come true sometimes You dreamed of your lord father in the crypts before we knew he was dead remember
