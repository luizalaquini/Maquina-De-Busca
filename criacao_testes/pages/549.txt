The denizens of Joffrey’s court had striven to outdo each other today Jalabhar Xho was all in feathers a plumage so fantastic and extravagant that he seemed like to take flight The High Septon’s crystal crown fired rainbows through the air every time he moved his head At the council table Queen Cersei shimmered in a cloth-of-gold gown slashed in burgundy velvet while beside her Varys fussed and simpered in a lilac brocade Moon Boy and Ser Dontos wore new suits of motley clean as a spring morning Even Lady Tanda and her daughters looked pretty in matching gowns of turquoise silk and vair and Lord Gyles was coughing into a square of scarlet silk trimmed with golden lace King Joffrey sat above them all amongst the blades and barbs of the Iron Throne He was in crimson samite his black mantle studded with rubies on his head his heavy golden crown

Squirming through a press of knights squires and rich townfolk Sansa reached the front of the gallery just as a blast of trumpets announced the entry of Lord Tywin Lannister

He rode his warhorse down the length of the hall and dismounted before the Iron Throne Sansa had never seen such armor all burnished red steel inlaid with golden scrollwork and ornamentation His rondels were sunbursts the roaring lion that crowned his helm had ruby eyes and a lioness on each shoulder fastened a cloth-of-gold cloak so long and heavy that it draped the hindquarters of his charger Even the horse’s armor was gilded and his bardings were shimmering crimson silk emblazoned with the lion of Lannister

The Lord of Casterly Rock made such an impressive figure that it was a shock when his destrier dropped a load of dung right at the base of the throne Joffrey had to step gingerly around it as he descended to embrace his grandfather and proclaim him Savior of the City Sansa covered her mouth to hide a nervous smile

Joff made a show of asking his grandfather to assume governance of the realm and Lord Tywin solemnly accepted the responsibility until Your Grace does come of age Then squires removed his armor and Joff fastened the Hand’s chain of office around his neck Lord Tywin took a seat at the council table beside the queen After the destrier was led off and his homage removed Cersei nodded for the ceremonies to continue

A fanfare of brazen trumpets greeted each of the heroes as he stepped between the great oaken doors Heralds cried his name and deeds for all to hear and the noble knights and highborn ladies cheered as lustily as cutthroats at a cockfight Pride of place was given to Mace Tyrell the Lord of Highgarden a once-powerful man gone to fat yet still handsome His sons followed him in Ser Loras and his older brother Ser Garlan the Gallant The three dressed alike in green velvet trimmed with sable

The king descended the throne once more to greet them a great honor He fastened about the throat of each a chain of roses wrought in soft yellow gold from which hung a golden disc with the lion of Lannister picked out in rubies The roses support the lion as the might of Highgarden supports the realm proclaimed Joffrey If there is any boon you would ask of me ask and it shall be yours

And now it comes thought Sansa

Your Grace said Ser Loras I beg the honor of serving in your Kingsguard to defend you against your enemies

Joffrey drew the Knight of Flowers to his feet and kissed him on his cheek Done brother

Lord Tyrell bowed his head There is no greater pleasure than to serve the King’s Grace If I was deemed worthy to join your royal council you would find none more loyal or true

Joff put a hand on Lord Tyrell’s shoulder and kissed him when he stood Your wish is granted

Ser Garlan Tyrell five years senior to Ser Loras was a taller bearded version of his more famous younger brother He was thicker about the chest and broader at the shoulders and though his face was comely enough he lacked Ser Loras’s startling beauty Your Grace Garlan said when the king approached him I have a maiden sister Margaery the delight of our House She was wed to Renly Baratheon as you know but Lord Renly went to war before the marriage could be consummated so she remains innocent Margaery has heard tales of your wisdom courage and chivalry and has come to love you from afar I beseech you to send for her to take her hand in marriage and to wed your House to mine for all time

King Joffrey made a show of looking surprised Ser Garlan your sister’s beauty is famed throughout the Seven Kingdoms but I am promised to another A king must keep his word

Queen Cersei got to her feet in a rustle of skirts Your Grace in the judgment of your small council it would be neither proper nor wise for you to wed the daughter of a man beheaded for treason a girl whose brother is in open rebellion against the throne even now Sire your councillors beg you for the good of your realm set Sansa Stark aside The Lady Margaery will make you a far more suitable queen

Like a pack of trained dogs the lords and ladies in the hall began to shout their pleasure Margaery they called Give us Margaery and No traitor queens Tyrell Tyrell

Joffrey raised a hand I would like to heed the wishes of my people Mother but I took a holy vow

The High Septon stepped forward Your Grace the gods hold bethrothal solemn but your father King Robert of blessed memory made this pact before the Starks of Winterfell had revealed their falseness Their crimes against the realm have freed you from any promise you might have made So far as the Faith is concerned there is no valid marriage contract ’twixt you and Sansa Stark

A tumult of cheering filled the throne room and cries of Margaery Margaery erupted all around her Sansa leaned forward her hands tight around the gallery’s wooden rail She knew what came next but she was still frightened of what Joffrey might say afraid that he would refuse to release her even now when his whole kingdom depended upon it She felt as if she were back again on the marble steps outside the Great Sept of Baelor waiting for her prince to grant her father mercy and instead hearing him command Ilyn Payne to strike off his head Please she prayed fervently make him say it make him say it

Lord Tywin was looking at his grandson Joff gave him a sullen glance shifted his feet and helped Ser Garlan Tyrell to rise The gods are good I am free to heed my heart I will wed your sweet sister and gladly ser He kissed Ser Garlan on a bearded cheek as the cheers rose all around them

Sansa felt curiously light-headed I am free She could feel eyes upon her I must not smile she reminded herself The queen had warned her no matter what she felt inside the face she showed the world must look distraught I will not have my son humiliated Cersei said Do you hear me

Yes But if I’m not to be queen what will become of me

That will need to be determined For the moment you shall remain here at court as our ward

I want to go home

The queen was irritated by that You should have learned by now none of us get the things we want

I have though Sansa thought I am free of Joffrey I will not have to kiss him nor give him my maidenhood nor bear him children Let Margaery Tyrell have all that poor girl

By the time the outburst died down the Lord of Highgarden had been seated at the council table and his sons had joined the other knights and lordlings beneath the windows Sansa tried to look forlorn and abandoned as other heroes of the Battle of the Blackwater were summoned forth to receive their rewards
