Something is happening across the lake said Jojen I thought I saw a man pointing at the tower

I won’t be afraid He was the Prince of Winterfell Eddard Stark’s son almost a man grown and a warg too not some little baby boy like Rickon Summer would not be afraid Most like they’re just some Umbers he said Or they could be Knotts or Norreys or Flints come down from the mountains or even brothers from the Night’s Watch Were they wearing black cloaks Jojen

By night all cloaks are black Your Grace And the flash came and went too fast for me to tell what they were wearing

Meera was wary If they were black brothers they’d be mounted wouldn’t they

Bran had thought of something else It doesn’t matter he said confidently They couldn’t get out to us even if they wanted Not unless they had a boat or knew about the causeway

The causeway Meera mussed Bran’s hair and kissed him on the forehead Our sweet prince He’s right Jojen they won’t know about the causeway Even if they did they could never find the way across at night in the rain

The night will end though If they stay till morning    Jojen left the rest unsaid After a few moments he said They are feeding the fire the first man started Lightning crashed through the sky and light filled the tower and etched them all in shadow Hodor rocked back and forth humming

Bran could feel Summer’s fear in that bright instant He closed two eyes and opened a third and his boy’s skin slipped off him like a cloak as he left the tower behind   

   and found himself out in the rain his belly full of deer cringing in the brush as the sky broke and boomed above him The smell of rotten apples and wet leaves almost drowned the scent of man but it was there He heard the clink and slither of hardskin saw men moving under the trees A man with a stick blundered by a skin pulled up over his head to make him blind and deaf The wolf went wide around him behind a dripping thornbush and beneath the bare branches of an apple tree He could hear them talking and there beneath the scents of rain and leaves and horse came the sharp red stench of fear   





JON

The ground was littered with pine needles and blown leaves a carpet of green and brown still damp from the recent rains It squished beneath their feet Huge bare oaks tall sentinels and hosts of soldier pines stood all around them On a hill above them was another roundtower ancient and empty thick green moss crawling up its side almost to the summit Who built that all of stone like that Ygritte asked him Some king

No Just the men who used to live here

What happened to them

They died or went away Brandon’s Gift had been farmed for thousands of years but as the Watch dwindled there were fewer hands to plow the fields tend the bees and plant the orchards so the wild had reclaimed many a field and hall In the New Gift there had been villages and holdfasts whose taxes rendered in goods and labor helped feed and clothe the black brothers But those were largely gone as well

They were fools to leave such a castle said Ygritte

It’s only a towerhouse Some little lordling lived there once with his family and a few sworn men When raiders came he would light a beacon from the roof Winterfell has towers three times the size of that

She looked as if she thought he was making that up How could men build so high with no giants to lift the stones

In legend Brandon the Builder had used giants to help raise Winterfell but Jon did not want to confuse the issue Men can build a lot higher than this In Oldtown there’s a tower taller than the Wall He could tell she did not believe him If I could show her Winterfell    give her a flower from the glass gardens feast her in the Great Hall and show her the stone kings on their thrones We could bathe in the hot pools and love beneath the heart tree while the old gods watched over us

The dream was sweet    but Winterfell would never be his to show It belonged to his brother the King in the North He was a Snow not a Stark Bastard oathbreaker and turncloak   

Might be after we could come back here and live in that tower she said Would you want that Jon Snow After

After The word was a spear thrust After the war After the conquest After the wildlings break the Wall   

His lord father had once talked about raising new lords and settling them in the abandoned holdfasts as a shield against wildlings The plan would have required the Watch to yield back a large part of the Gift but his uncle Benjen believed the Lord Commander could be won around so long as the new lordlings paid taxes to Castle Black rather than Winterfell It is a dream for spring though Lord Eddard had said Even the promise of land will not lure men north with a winter coming on

If winter had come and gone more quickly and spring had followed in its turn I might have been chosen to hold one of these towers in my father’s name Lord Eddard was dead however his brother Benjen lost the shield they dreamt together would never be forged This land belongs to the Watch Jon said

Her nostrils flared No one lives here

Your raiders drove them off

They were cowards then If they wanted the land they should have stayed and fought

Maybe they were tired of fighting Tired of barring their doors every night and wondering if Rattleshirt or someone like him would break them down to carry off their wives Tired of having their harvests stolen and any valuables they might have It’s easier to move beyond the reach of raiders But if the Wall should fail all the north will lie within the reach of raiders

You know nothing Jon Snow Daughters are taken not wives You’re the ones who steal You took the whole world and built the Wall t’ keep the free folk out

Did we Sometimes Jon forgot how wild she was and then she would remind him How did that happen

The gods made the earth for all men t’ share Only when the kings come with their crowns and steel swords they claimed it was all theirs My trees they said you can’t eat them apples My stream you can’t fish here My wood you’re not t’ hunt My earth my water my castle my daughter keep your hands away or I’ll chop ’em off but maybe if you kneel t’ me I’ll let you have a sniff You call us thieves but at least a thief has t’ be brave and clever and quick A kneeler only has t’ kneel

Harma and the Bag of Bones don’t come raiding for fish and apples They steal swords and axes Spices silks and furs They grab every coin and ring and jeweled cup they can find casks of wine in summer and casks of beef in winter and they take women in any season and carry them off beyond the Wall

And what if they do I’d sooner be stolen by a strong man than be given t’ some weakling by my father

You say that but how can you know What if you were stolen by someone you hated

He’d have t’ be quick and cunning and brave t’ steal me So his sons would be strong and smart as well Why would I hate such a man as that

Maybe he never washes so he smells as rank as a bear

Then I’d push him in a stream or throw a bucket o’ water on him Anyhow men shouldn’t smell sweet like flowers

What’s wrong with flowers

Nothing for a bee For bed I want one o’ these Ygritte made to grab the front of his breeches

Jon caught her wrist What if the man who stole you drank too much he insisted What if he was brutal or cruel He tightened his grip to make a point What if he was stronger than you and liked to beat you bloody

I’d cut his throat while he slept You know nothing Jon Snow Ygritte twisted like an eel and wrenched away from him

I know one thing I know that you are wildling to the bone It was easy to forget that sometimes when they were laughing together or kissing But then one of them would say something or do something and he would suddenly be reminded of the wall between their worlds

A man can own a woman or a man can own a knife Ygritte told him but no man can own both Every little girl learns that from her mother She raised her chin defiantly and gave her thick red hair a shake And men can’t own the land no more’n they can own the sea or the sky You kneelers think you do but Mance is going t’ show you different

It was a fine brave boast but it rang hollow Jon glanced back to make certain the Magnar was not in earshot Errok Big Boil and Hempen Dan were walking a few yards behind them but paying no attention Big Boil was complaining of his arse Ygritte he said in a low voice Mance cannot win this war

He can she insisted You know nothing Jon Snow You have never seen the free folk fight

Wildlings fought like heroes or demons depending on who you talked to but it came down to the same thing in the end They fight with reckless courage every man out for glory I don’t doubt that you’re all very brave but when it comes to battle discipline beats valor every time In the end Mance will fail as all the Kings-beyond-the-Wall have failed before him And when he does you’ll die All of you

Ygritte had looked so angry he thought she was about to strike him All of us she said You too You’re no crow now Jon Snow I swore you weren’t so you better not be She pushed him back against the trunk of a tree and kissed him full on the lips right there in the midst of the ragged column Jon heard Grigg the Goat urging her on Someone else laughed He kissed her back despite all that When they finally broke apart Ygritte was flushed You’re mine she whispered Mine as I’m yours And if we die we die All men must die Jon Snow But first we’ll live

Yes His voice was thick First we’ll live

She grinned at that showing Jon the crooked teeth that he had somehow come to love Wildling to the bone he thought again with a sick sad feeling in the pit of his stomach He flexed the fingers of his sword hand and wondered what Ygritte would do if she knew his heart Would she betray him if he sat her down and told her that he was still Ned Stark’s son and a man of the Night’s Watch He hoped not but he dare not take that risk Too many lives depended on his somehow reaching Castle Black before the Magnar    assuming he found a chance to escape the wildlings
