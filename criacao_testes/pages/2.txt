presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden

39 And the LORD God called unto Adam and said unto him Where art
thou  310 And he said I heard thy voice in the garden and I was
afraid because I was naked and I hid myself

311 And he said Who told thee that thou wast naked Hast thou eaten
of the tree whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat
312 And the man said The woman whom thou gavest to be with me she
gave me of the tree and I did eat

313 And the LORD God said unto the woman What is this that thou hast
done And the woman said The serpent beguiled me and I did eat

314 And the LORD God said unto the serpent Because thou hast done
this thou art cursed above all cattle and above every beast of the
field upon thy belly shalt thou go and dust shalt thou eat all the
days of thy life 315 And I will put enmity between thee and the
woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head
and thou shalt bruise his heel

316 Unto the woman he said I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and
thy conception in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children and thy
desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee

317 And unto Adam he said Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice
of thy wife and hast eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee
saying Thou shalt not eat of it cursed is the ground for thy sake
in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life 318 Thorns
also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee and thou shalt eat the
herb of the field 319 In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread
till thou return unto the ground for out of it wast thou taken for
dust thou art and unto dust shalt thou return

320 And Adam called his wifes name Eve because she was the mother
of all living

321 Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of
skins and clothed them

322 And the LORD God said Behold the man is become as one of us to
know good and evil and now lest he put forth his hand and take also
of the tree of life and eat and live for ever 323 Therefore the
LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden to till the ground
from whence he was taken

324 So he drove out the man and he placed at the east of the garden
of Eden Cherubims and a flaming sword which turned every way to keep
the way of the tree of life

41 And Adam knew Eve his wife and she conceived and bare Cain and
said I have gotten a man from the LORD

42 And she again bare his brother Abel And Abel was a keeper of
sheep but Cain was a tiller of the ground

43 And in process of time it came to pass that Cain brought of the
fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD

44 And Abel he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of
the fat thereof And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his
offering 45 But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect
And Cain was very wroth and his countenance fell

46 And the LORD said unto Cain Why art thou wroth and why is thy
countenance fallen  47 If thou doest well shalt thou not be
accepted and if thou doest not well sin lieth at the door And unto
thee shall be his desire and thou shalt rule over him

48 And Cain talked with Abel his brother and it came to pass when
they were in the field that Cain rose up against Abel his brother
and slew him

49 And the LORD said unto Cain Where is Abel thy brother And he
said I know not Am I my brothers keeper  410 And he said What
hast thou done the voice of thy brothers blood crieth unto me from
the ground

411 And now art thou cursed from the earth which hath opened her
mouth to receive thy brothers blood from thy hand 412 When thou
tillest the ground it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her
strength a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth

413 And Cain said unto the LORD My punishment is greater than I can
bear

414 Behold thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the
earth and from thy face shall I be hid and I shall be a fugitive and
a vagabond in the earth and it shall come to pass that every one
that findeth me shall slay me

415 And the LORD said unto him Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain
vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold And the LORD set a mark
upon Cain lest any finding him should kill him

416 And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD and dwelt in the
land of Nod on the east of Eden

417 And Cain knew his wife and she conceived and bare Enoch and he
builded a city and called the name of the city after the name of his
