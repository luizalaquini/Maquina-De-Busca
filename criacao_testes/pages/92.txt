Stannis again Ned thought He found that curious Jon Arryn and he had been cordial but never friendly And while Robert had been riding north to Winterfell Stannis had removed himself to Dragonstone the Targaryen island fastness he had conquered in his brother’s name He had given no word as to when he might return Where did they go on these rides Ned asked

The boy says that they visited a brothel

A brothel Ned said The Lord of the Eyrie and Hand of the King visited a brothel with Stannis Baratheon He shook his head incredulous wondering what Lord Renly would make of this tidbit Robert’s lusts were the subject of ribald drinking songs throughout the realm but Stannis was a different sort of man a bare year younger than the king yet utterly unlike him stern humorless unforgiving grim in his sense of duty

The boy insists it’s true The Hand took three guardsmen with him and the boy says they were joking of it when he took their horses afterward

Which brothel Ned asked

The boy did not know The guards would

A pity Lysa carried them off to the Vale Ned said dryly The gods are doing their best to vex us Lady Lysa Maester Colemon Lord Stannis… everyone who might actually know the truth of what happened to Jon Arryn is a thousand leagues away

Will you summon Lord Stannis back from Dragonstone

Not yet Ned said Not until I have a better notion of what this is all about and where he stands The matter nagged at him Why did Stannis leave Had he played some part in Jon Arryn’s murder Or was he afraid Ned found it hard to imagine what could frighten Stannis Baratheon who had once held Storm’s End through a year of siege surviving on rats and boot leather while the Lords Tyrell and Redwyne sat outside with their hosts banqueting in sight of his walls

Bring me my doublet if you would The grey with the direwolf sigil I want this armorer to know who I am It might make him more forthcoming

Jory went to the wardrobe Lord Renly is brother to Lord Stannis as well as the king

Yet it seems that he was not invited on these rides Ned was not sure what to make of Renly with all his friendly ways and easy smiles A few days past he had taken Ned aside to show him an exquisite rose gold locklet Inside was a miniature painted in the vivid Myrish style of a lovely young girl with doe’s eyes and a cascade of soft brown hair Renly had seemed anxious to know if the girl reminded him of anyone and when Ned had no answer but a shrug he had seemed disappointed The maid was Loras Tyrell’s sister Margaery he’d confessed but there were those who said she looked like Lyanna No Ned had told him bemused Could it be that Lord Renly who looked so like a young Robert had conceived a passion for a girl he fancied to be a young Lyanna That struck him as more than passing queer

Jory held out the doublet and Ned slid his hands through the armholes Perhaps Lord Stannis will return for Robert’s tourney he said as Jory laced the garment up the back

That would be a stroke of fortune my lord Jory said

Ned buckled on a longsword In other words not bloody likely His smile was grim

Jory draped Ned’s cloak across his shoulders and clasped it at the throat with the Hand’s badge of office The armorer lives above his shop in a large house at the top of the Street of Steel Alyn knows the way my lord

Ned nodded The gods help this potboy if he’s sent me off haring after shadows It was a slim enough staff to lean on but the Jon Arryn that Ned Stark had known was not one to wear jeweled and silvered plate Steel was steel it was meant for protection not ornament He might have changed his views to be sure He would scarcely have been the first man who came to look on things differently after a few years at court… but the change was marked enough to make Ned wonder

Is there any other service I might perform

I suppose you’d best begin visiting whorehouses

Hard duty my lord Jory grinned The men will be glad to help Porther has made a fair start already

Ned’s favorite horse was saddled and waiting in the yard Varly and Jacks fell in beside him as he rode through the yard Their steel caps and shirts of mail must have been sweltering yet they said no word of complaint As Lord Eddard passed beneath the King’s Gate into the stink of the city his grey and white cloak streaming from his shoulders he saw eyes everywhere and kicked his mount into a trot His guard followed

He looked behind him frequently as they made their way through the crowded city streets Tomard and Desmond had left the castle early this morning to take up positions on the route they must take and watch for anyone following them but even so Ned was uncertain The shadow of the King’s Spider and his little birds had him fretting like a maiden on her wedding night

The Street of Steel began at the market square beside the River Gate as it was named on maps or the Mud Gate as it was commonly called A mummer on stilts was striding through the throngs like some great insect with a horde of barefoot children trailing behind him hooting Elsewhere two ragged boys no older than Bran were dueling with sticks to the loud encouragement of some and the furious curses of others An old woman ended the contest by leaning out of her window and emptying a bucket of slops on the heads of the combatants In the shadow of the wall farmers stood beside their wagons bellowing out Apples the best apples cheap at twice the price and Blood melons sweet as honey and Turnips onions roots here you go here here you go turnips onions roots here you go here

The Mud Gate was open and a squad of City Watchmen stood under the portcullis in their golden cloaks leaning on spears When a column of riders appeared from the west the guardsmen sprang into action shouting commands and moving the carts and foot traffic aside to let the knight enter with his escort The first rider through the gate carried a long black banner The silk rippled in the wind like a living thing across the fabric was blazoned a night sky slashed with purple lightning Make way for Lord Beric the rider shouted Make way for Lord Beric And close behind came the young lord himself a dashing figure on a black courser with red-gold hair and a black satin cloak dusted with stars Here to fight in the Hand’s tourney my lord a guardsman called out to him Here to win the Hand’s tourney Lord Beric shouted back as the crowd cheered

Ned turned off the square where the Street of Steel began and followed its winding path up a long hill past blacksmiths working at open forges freeriders haggling over mail shirts and grizzled ironmongers selling old blades and razors from their wagons The farther they climbed the larger the buildings grew The man they wanted was all the way at the top of the hill in a huge house of timber and plaster whose upper stories loomed over the narrow street The double doors showed a hunting scene carved in ebony and weirwood A pair of stone knights stood sentry at the entrance armored in fanciful suits of polished red steel that transformed them into griffin and unicorn Ned left his horse with Jacks and shouldered his way inside

The slim young serving girl took quick note of Ned’s badge and the sigil on his doublet and the master came hurrying out all smiles and bows Wine for the King’s Hand he told the girl gesturing Ned to a couch I am Tobho Mott my lord please please put yourself at ease He wore a black velvet coat with hammers embroidered on the sleeves in silver thread Around his neck was a heavy silver chain and a sapphire as large as a pigeon’s egg If you are in need of new arms for the Hand’s tourney you have come to the right shop Ned did not bother to correct him My work is costly and I make no apologies for that my lord he said as he filled two matching silver goblets You will not find craftsmanship equal to mine anywhere in the Seven Kingdoms I promise you Visit every forge in King’s Landing if you like and compare for yourself Any village smith can hammer out a shirt of mail my work is art

Ned sipped his wine and let the man go on The Knight of Flowers bought all his armor here Tobho boasted and many high lords the ones who knew fine steel and even Lord Renly the king’s own brother Perhaps the Hand had seen Lord Renly’s new armor the green plate with the golden antlers No other armorer in the city could get that deep a green he knew the secret of putting color in the steel itself paint and enamel were the crutches of a journeyman Or mayhaps the Hand wanted a blade Tobho had learned to work Valyrian steel at the forges of Qohor as a boy Only a man who knew the spells could take old weapons and forge them anew The direwolf is the sigil of House Stark is it not I could fashion a direwolf helm so real that children will run from you in the street he vowed
