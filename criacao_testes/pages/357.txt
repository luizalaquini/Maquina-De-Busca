His guest rose This has been quite the pleasant morning Lannister And profitable… for both of us I trust He bowed his cape a swirl of yellow as he strode out the door

Two thought Tyrion

He went up to his bedchamber to await Varys who would soon be making an appearance Evenfall he guessed Perhaps as late as moonrise though he hoped not He hoped to visit Shae tonight He was pleasantly surprised when Galt of the Stone Crows informed him not an hour later that the powdered man was at his door You are a cruel man to make the Grand Maester squirm so the eunuch scolded The man cannot abide a secret

Is that a crow I hear calling the raven black Or would you sooner not hear what I’ve proposed to Doran Martell

Varys giggled Perhaps my little birds have told me

Have they indeed He wanted to hear this Go on

The Dornishmen thus far have held aloof from these wars Doran Martell has called his banners but no more His hatred for House Lannister is well known and it is commonly thought he will join Lord Renly You wish to dissuade him

All this is obvious said Tyrion

The only puzzle is what you might have offered for his allegiance The prince is a sentimental man and he still mourns his sister Elia and her sweet babe

My father once told me that a lord never lets sentiment get in the way of ambition… and it happens we have an empty seat on the small council now that Lord Janos has taken the black

A council seat is not to be despised Varys admitted yet will it be enough to make a proud man forget his sister’s murder

Why forget Tyrion smiled I’ve promised to deliver his sister’s killers alive or dead as he prefers After the war is done to be sure

Varys gave him a shrewd look My little birds tell me that Princess Elia cried a… certain name… when they came for her

Is a secret still a secret if everyone knows it In Casterly Rock it was common knowledge that Gregor Clegane had killed Elia and her babe They said he had raped the princess with her son’s blood and brains still on his hands

This secret is your lord father’s sworn man

My father would be the first to tell you that fifty thousand Dornishmen are worth one rabid dog

Varys stroked a powdered cheek And if Prince Doran demands the blood of the lord who gave the command as well as the knight who did the deed…

Robert Baratheon led the rebellion All commands came from him in the end

Robert was not at King’s Landing

Neither was Doran Martell

So Blood for his pride a chair for his ambition Gold and land that goes without saying A sweet offer… yet sweets can be poisoned If I were the prince something more would I require before I should reach for this honeycomb Some token of good faith some sure safeguard against betrayal Varys smiled his slimiest smile Which one will you give him I wonder

Tyrion sighed You know don’t you

Since you put it that way—yes Tommen You could scarcely offer Myrcella to Doran Martell and Lysa Arryn both

Remind me never to play these guessing games with you again You cheat 

Prince Tommen is a good boy

If I pry him away from Cersei and Joffrey while he’s still young he may even grow to be a good man

And a good king
