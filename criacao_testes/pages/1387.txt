I call that madness not courage said Arstan Whitebeard when the solemn little scribe was done He tapped the end of his hardwood staff against the bricks tap tap as if to tell his displeasure The old man had not wanted to sail to Astapor nor did he favor buying this slave army A queen should hear all sides before reaching a decision That was why Dany had brought him with her to the Plaza of Pride not to keep her safe Her bloodriders would do that well enough Ser Jorah Mormont she had left aboard Balerion to guard her people and her dragons Much against her inclination she had locked the dragons belowdecks It was too dangerous to let them fly freely over the city the world was all too full of men who would gladly kill them for no better reason than to name themselves dragonslayer

What did the smelly old man say the slaver demanded of his translator When she told him he smiled and said Inform the savages that we call this obedience Others may be stronger or quicker or larger than the Unsullied Some few may even equal their skill with sword and spear and shield But nowhere between the seas will you ever find any more obedient

Sheep are obedient said Arstan when the words had been translated He had some Valyrian as well though not so much as Dany but like her he was feigning ignorance

Kraznys mo Nakloz showed his big white teeth when that was rendered back to him A word from me and these sheep would spill his stinking old bowels on the bricks he said but do not say that Tell them that these creatures are more dogs than sheep Do they eat dogs or horse in these Seven Kingdoms

They prefer pigs and cows your worship

Beef Pfag Food for unwashed savages

Ignoring them all Dany walked slowly down the line of slave soldiers The girls followed close behind with the silk awning to keep her in the shade but the thousand men before her enjoyed no such protection More than half had the copper skins and almond eyes of Dothraki and Lhazerene but she saw men of the Free Cities in the ranks as well along with pale Qartheen ebon-faced Summer Islanders and others whose origins she could not guess And some had skins of the same amber hue as Kraznys mo Nakloz and the bristly red-black hair that marked the ancient folk of Ghis who named themselves the harpy’s sons They sell even their own kind It should not have surprised her The Dothraki did the same when khalasar met khalasar in the sea of grass

Some of the soldiers were tall and some were short They ranged in age from fourteen to twenty she judged Their cheeks were smooth and their eyes all the same be they black or brown or blue or grey or amber They are like one man Dany thought until she remembered that they were no men at all The Unsullied were eunuchs every one of them Why do you cut them she asked Kraznys through the slave girl Whole men are stronger than eunuchs I have always heard

A eunuch who is cut young will never have the brute strength of one of your Westerosi knights this is true said Kraznys mo Nakloz when the question was put to him A bull is strong as well but bulls die every day in the fighting pits A girl of nine killed one not three days past in Jothiel’s Pit The Unsullied have something better than strength tell her They have discipline We fight in the fashion of the Old Empire yes They are the lockstep legions of Old Ghis come again absolutely obedient absolutely loyal and utterly without fear

Dany listened patiently to the translation

Even the bravest men fear death and maiming Arstan said when the girl was done

Kraznys smiled again when he heard that Tell the old man that he smells of piss and needs a stick to hold him up

Truly your worship

He poked her with his lash No not truly are you a girl or a goat to ask such folly Say that Unsullied are not men Say that death means nothing to them and maiming less than nothing He stopped before a thickset man who had the look of Lhazar about him and brought his whip up sharply laying a line of blood across one copper cheek The eunuch blinked and stood there bleeding Would you like another asked Kraznys

If it please your worship

It was hard to pretend not to understand Dany laid a hand on Kraznys’s arm before he could raise the whip again Tell the Good Master that I see how strong his Unsullied are and how bravely they suffer pain

Kraznys chuckled when he heard her words in Valyrian Tell this ignorant whore of a westerner that courage has nothing to do with it

The Good Master says that was not courage Your Grace

Tell her to open those slut’s eyes of hers

He begs you attend this carefully Your Grace

Kraznys moved to the next eunuch in line a towering youth with the blue eyes and flaxen hair of Lys Your sword he said The eunuch knelt unsheathed the blade and offered it up hilt first It was a shortsword made more for stabbing than for slashing but the edge looked razor-sharp Stand Kraznys commanded

Your worship The eunuch stood and Kraznys mo Nakloz slid the sword slowly up his torso leaving a thin red line across his belly and between his ribs Then he jabbed the swordpoint in beneath a wide pink nipple and began to work it back and forth

What is he doing Dany demanded of the girl as the blood ran down the man’s chest

Tell the cow to stop her bleating said Kraznys without waiting for the translation This will do him no great harm Men have no need of nipples eunuchs even less so The nipple hung by a thread of skin He slashed and sent it tumbling to the bricks leaving behind a round red eye copiously weeping blood The eunuch did not move until Kraznys offered him back his sword hilt first Here I’m done with you

This one is pleased to have served you

Kraznys turned back to Dany They feel no pain you see

How can that be she demanded through the scribe

The wine of courage was the answer he gave her It is no true wine at all but made from deadly nightshade bloodfly larva black lotus root and many secret things They drink it with every meal from the day they are cut and with each passing year feel less and less It makes them fearless in battle Nor can they be tortured Tell the savage her secrets are safe with the Unsullied She may set them to guard her councils and even her bedchamber and never a worry as to what they might overhear

In Yunkai and Meereen eunuchs are often made by removing a boy’s testicles but leaving the penis Such a creature is infertile yet often still capable of erection Only trouble can come of this We remove the penis as well leaving nothing The Unsullied are the purest creatures on the earth He gave Dany and Arstan another of his broad white smiles I have heard that in the Sunset Kingdoms men take solemn vows to keep chaste and father no children but live only for their duty Is it not so

It is Arstan said when the question was put There are many such orders The maesters of the Citadel the septons and septas who serve the Seven the silent sisters of the dead the Kingsguard and the Night’s Watch…

Poor things growled the slaver after the translation Men were not made to live thus Their days are a torment of temptation any fool must see and no doubt most succumb to their baser selves Not so our Unsullied They are wed to their swords in a way that your Sworn Brothers cannot hope to match No woman can ever tempt them nor any man

His girl conveyed the essence of his speech more politely There are other ways to tempt men besides the flesh Arstan Whitebeard objected when she was done

Men yes but not Unsullied Plunder interests them no more than rape They own nothing but their weapons We do not even permit them names

No names Dany frowned at the little scribe Can that be what the Good Master said They have no names

It is so Your Grace

Kraznys stopped in front of a Ghiscari who might have been his taller fitter brother and flicked his lash at a small bronze disk on the swordbelt at his feet There is his name Ask the whore of Westeros whether she can read Ghiscari glyphs When Dany admitted that she could not the slaver turned to the Unsullied What is your name he demanded

This one’s name is Red Flea your worship

The girl repeated their exchange in the Common Tongue

And yesterday what was it

Black Rat your worship

The day before

Brown Flea your worship

Before that

This one does not recall your worship Blue Toad perhaps Or Blue Worm

Tell her all their names are such Kraznys commanded the girl It reminds them that by themselves they are vermin The name disks are thrown in an empty cask at duty’s end and each dawn plucked up again at random

More madness said Arstan when he heard How can any man possibly remember a new name every day

Those who cannot are culled in training along with those who cannot run all day in full pack scale a mountain in the black of night walk across a bed of coals or slay an infant

Dany’s mouth surely twisted at that Did he see or is he blind as well as cruel She turned away quickly trying to keep her face a mask until she heard the translation Only then did she allow herself to say Whose infants do they slay

To win his spiked cap an Unsullied must go to the slave marts with a silver mark find some wailing newborn and kill it before its mother’s eyes In this way we make certain that there is no weakness left in them

She was feeling faint The heat she tried to tell herself You take a babe from its mother’s arms kill it as she watches and pay for her pain with a silver coin
