Davos groped for some other answer Storm’s End holds no knight who can match Ser Guyard or Lord Caron or any of a hundred others sworn to your service This single combat… could it be that Ser Cortnay seeks for a way to yield with honor Even if it means his own life

A troubled look crossed the king’s face like a passing cloud More like he plans some treachery There will be no combat of champions Ser Cortnay was dead before he ever threw that glove The flames do not lie Davos

Yet they require me to make them true he thought It had been a long time since Davos Seaworth felt so sad

And so it was that he found himself once more crossing Shipbreaker Bay in the dark of night steering a tiny boat with a black sail The sky was the same and the sea The same salt smell was in the air and the water chuckling against the hull was just as he remembered it A thousand flickering campfires burned around the castle as the fires of the Tyrells and Redwynes had sixteen years before But all the rest was different

The last time it was life I brought to Storm’s End shaped to look like onions This time it is death in the shape of Melisandre of Asshai Sixteen years ago the sails had cracked and snapped with every shift of wind until he’d pulled them down and gone on with muffled oars Even so his heart had been in his gullet The men on the Redwyne galleys had grown lax after so long however and they had slipped through the cordon smooth as black satin This time the only ships in sight belonged to Stannis and the only danger would come from watchers on the castle walls Even so Davos was taut as a bowstring

Melisandre huddled upon a thwart lost in the folds of a dark red cloak that covered her from head to heels her face a paleness beneath the cowl Davos loved the water He slept best when he had a deck rocking beneath him and the sighing of the wind in his rigging was a sweeter sound to him than any a singer could make with his harp strings Even the sea brought him no comfort tonight though I can smell the fear on you ser knight the red woman said softly

Someone once told me the night is dark and full of terrors And tonight I am no knight Tonight I am Davos the smuggler again Would that you were an onion

She laughed Is it me you fear Or what we do

What you do I’ll have no part of it

Your hand raised the sail Your hand holds the tiller

Silent Davos tended to his course The shore was a snarl of rocks so he was taking them well out across the bay He would wait for the tide to turn before coming about Storm’s End dwindled behind them but the red woman seemed unconcerned Are you a good man Davos Seaworth she asked

Would a good man be doing this I am a man he said I am kind to my wife but I have known other women I have tried to be a father to my sons to help make them a place in this world Aye I’ve broken laws but I never felt evil until tonight I would say my parts are mixed m’lady Good and bad

A grey man she said Neither white nor black but partaking of both Is that what you are Ser Davos

What if I am It seems to me that most men are grey

If half of an onion is black with rot it is a rotten onion A man is good or he is evil

The fires behind them had melted into one vague glow against the black sky and the land was almost out of sight It was time to come about Watch your head my lady He pushed on the tiller and the small boat threw up a curl of black water as she turned Melisandre leaned under the swinging yard one hand on the gunwale calm as ever Wood creaked canvas cracked and water splashed so loudly a man might swear the castle was sure to hear Davos knew better The endless crash of wave on rock was the only sound that ever penetrated the massive seaward walls of Storm’s End and that but faintly

A rippling wake spread out behind as they swung back toward the shore You speak of men and onions Davos said to Melisandre What of women Is it not the same for them Are you good or evil my lady

That made her chuckle Oh good I am a knight of sorts myself sweet ser A champion of light and life

Yet you mean to kill a man tonight he said As you killed Maester Cressen

Your maester poisoned himself He meant to poison me but I was protected by a greater power and he was not

And Renly Baratheon Who was it who killed him

Her head turned Beneath the shadow of the cowl her eyes burned like pale red candle flames Not I

Liar Davos was certain now

Melisandre laughed again You are lost in darkness and confusion Ser Davos

And a good thing Davos gestured at the distant lights flickering along the walls of Storm’s End Feel how cold the wind is The guards will huddle close to those torches A little warmth a little light they’re a comfort on a night like this Yet that will blind them so they will not see us pass I hope The god of darkness protects us now my lady Even you

The flames of her eyes seemed to burn a little brighter at that Speak not that name ser Lest you draw his black eye upon us He protects no man I promise you He is the enemy of all that lives It is the torches that hide us you have said so yourself Fire The bright gift of the Lord of Light

Have it your way

His way rather

The wind was shifting Davos could feel it see it in the way the black canvas rippled He reached for the halyards Help me bring in the sail I’ll row us the rest of the way

Together they tied off the sail as the boat rocked beneath them As Davos unshipped the oars and slid them into the choppy black water he said Who rowed you to Renly

There was no need she said He was unprotected But here… this Storm’s End is an old place There are spells woven into the stones Dark walls that no shadow can pass—ancient forgotten yet still in place

Shadow Davos felt his flesh prickling A shadow is a thing of darkness

You are more ignorant than a child ser knight There are no shadows in the dark Shadows are the servants of light the children of fire The brightest flame casts the darkest shadows

Frowning Davos hushed her then They were coming close to shore once more and voices carried across the water He rowed the faint sound of his oars lost in the rhythm of the waves The seaward side of Storm’s End perched upon a pale white cliff the chalky stone sloping up steeply to half again the height of the massive curtain wall A mouth yawned in the cliff and it was that Davos steered for as he had sixteen years before The tunnel opened on a cavern under the castle where the storm lords of old had built their landing

The passage was navigable only during high tide and was never less than treacherous but his smuggler’s skills had not deserted him Davos threaded their way deftly between the jagged rocks until the cave mouth loomed up before them He let the waves carry them inside They crashed around him slamming the boat this way and that and soaking them to the skin A half-seen finger of rock came rushing up out of the gloom snarling foam and Davos barely kept them off it with an oar

Then they were past engulfed in darkness and the waters smoothed

The little boat slowed and swirled The sound of their breathing echoed until it seemed to surround them Davos had not expected the blackness The last time torches had burned all along the tunnel and the eyes of starving men had peered down through the murder holes in the ceiling The portcullis was somewhere ahead he knew Davos used the oars to slow them and they drifted against it almost gently

This is as far as we go unless you have a man inside to lift the gate for us His whispers scurried across the lapping water like a line of mice on soft pink feet

Have we passed within the walls

Yes Beneath But we can go no farther The portcullis goes all the way to the bottom And the bars are too closely spaced for even a child to squeeze through

There was no answer but a soft rustling And then a light bloomed amidst the darkness

Davos raised a hand to shield his eyes and his breath caught in his throat Melisandre had thrown back her cowl and shrugged out of the smothering robe Beneath she was naked and huge with child Swollen breasts hung heavy against her chest and her belly bulged as if near to bursting Gods preserve us he whispered and heard her answering laugh deep and throaty Her eyes were hot coals and the sweat that dappled her skin seemed to glow with a light of its own Melisandre shone

Panting she squatted and spread her legs Blood ran down her thighs black as ink Her cry might have been agony or ecstasy or both And Davos saw the crown of the child’s head push its way out of her Two arms wriggled free grasping black fingers coiling around Melisandre’s straining thighs pushing until the whole of the shadow slid out into the world and rose taller than Davos tall as the tunnel towering above the boat He had only an instant to look at it before it was gone twisting between the bars of the portcullis and racing across the surface of the water but that instant was long enough

He knew that shadow As he knew the man who’d cast it





JON

The call came drifting through the black of night Jon pushed himself onto an elbow his hand reaching for Longclaw by force of habit as the camp began to stir The horn that wakes the sleepers he thought

The long low note lingered at the edge of hearing The sentries at the ringwall stood still in their footsteps breath frosting and heads turned toward the west As the sound of the horn faded even the wind ceased to blow Men rolled from their blankets and reached for spears and swordbelts moving quietly listening A horse whickered and was hushed For a heartbeat it seemed as if the whole forest were holding its breath The brothers of the Night’s Watch waited for a second blast praying they should not hear it fearing that they would

When the silence had stretched unbearably long and the men knew at last that the horn would not wind again they grinned at one another sheepishly as if to deny that they had been anxious Jon Snow fed a few sticks to the fire buckled on his swordbelt pulled on his boots shook the dirt and dew from the cloak and fastened it around his shoulders The flames blazed up beside him welcome heat beating against his face as he dressed He could hear the Lord Commander moving inside the tent After a moment Mormont lifted the flap One blast On his shoulder his raven sat fluffed and silent looking miserable
