Maester Luwin looked from Catelyn to her son I have prepared a list of those we might wish to consider for the vacant offices he said offering Robb a paper plucked from his sleeve

Her son glanced at the names He had come from outside Catelyn saw his cheeks were red from the cold his hair shaggy and windblown Good men he said We’ll talk about them tomorrow He handed back the list of names

Very good my lord The paper vanished into his sleeve

Leave us now Robb said Maester Luwin bowed and departed Robb closed the door behind him and turned to her He was wearing a sword she saw Mother what are you doing

Catelyn had always thought Robb looked like her like Bran and Rickon and Sansa he had the Tully coloring the auburn hair the blue eyes Yet now for the first time she saw something of Eddard Stark in his face something as stern and hard as the north What am I doing she echoed puzzled How can you ask that What do you imagine I’m doing I am taking care of your brother I am taking care of Bran

Is that what you call it You haven’t left this room since Bran was hurt You didn’t even come to the gate when Father and the girls went south

I said my farewells to them here and watched them ride out from that window She had begged Ned not to go not now not after what had happened everything had changed now couldn’t he see that It was no use He had no choice he had told her and then he left choosing I can’t leave him even for a moment not when any moment could be his last I have to be with him if… if… She took her son’s limp hand sliding his fingers through her own He was so frail and thin with no strength left in his hand but she could still feel the warmth of life through his skin

Robb’s voice softened He’s not going to die Mother Maester Luwin says the time of greatest danger has passed

And what if Maester Luwin is wrong What if Bran needs me and I’m not here

Rickon needs you Robb said sharply He’s only three he doesn’t understand what’s happening He thinks everyone has deserted him so he follows me around all day clutching my leg and crying I don’t know what to do with him He paused a moment chewing on his lower lip the way he’d done when he was little Mother I need you too I’m trying but I can’t… I can’t do it all by myself His voice broke with sudden emotion and Catelyn remembered that he was only fourteen She wanted to get up and go to him but Bran was still holding her hand and she could not move

Outside the tower a wolf began to howl Catelyn trembled just for a second

Bran’s Robb opened the window and let the night air into the stuffy tower room The howling grew louder It was a cold and lonely sound full of melancholy and despair

Don’t she told him Bran needs to stay warm

He needs to hear them sing Robb said Somewhere out in Winterfell a second wolf began to howl in chorus with the first Then a third closer Shaggydog and Grey Wind Robb said as their voices rose and fell together You can tell them apart if you listen close

Catelyn was shaking It was the grief the cold the howling of the direwolves Night after night the howling and the cold wind and the grey empty castle on and on they went never changing and her boy lying there broken the sweetest of her children the gentlest Bran who loved to laugh and climb and dreamt of knighthood all gone now she would never hear him laugh again Sobbing she pulled her hand free of his and covered her ears against those terrible howls Make them stop she cried I can’t stand it make them stop make them stop kill them all if you must just make them stop

She didn’t remember falling to the floor but there she was and Robb was lifting her holding her in strong arms Don’t be afraid Mother They would never hurt him He helped her to her narrow bed in the corner of the sickroom Close your eyes he said gently Rest Maester Luwin tells me you’ve hardly slept since Bran’s fall

I can’t she wept Gods forgive me Robb I can’t what if he dies while I’m asleep what if he dies what if he dies… The wolves were still howling She screamed and held her ears again Oh gods close the window

If you swear to me you’ll sleep Robb went to the window but as he reached for the shutters another sound was added to the mournful howling of the direwolves Dogs he said listening All the dogs are barking They’ve never done that before… Catelyn heard his breath catch in his throat When she looked up his face was pale in the lamplight Fire he whispered

Fire she thought and then Bran Help me she said urgently sitting up Help me with Bran

Robb did not seem to hear her The library tower’s on fire he said

Catelyn could see the flickering reddish light through the open window now She sagged with relief Bran was safe The library was across the bailey there was no way the fire would reach them here Thank the gods she whispered

Robb looked at her as if she’d gone mad Mother stay here I’ll come back as soon as the fire’s out He ran then She heard him shout to the guards outside the room heard them descending together in a wild rush taking the stairs two and three at a time

Outside there were shouts of Fire in the yard screams running footsteps the whinny of frightened horses and the frantic barking of the castle dogs The howling was gone she realized as she listened to the cacophony The direwolves had fallen silent

Catelyn said a silent prayer of thanks to the seven faces of god as she went to the window Across the bailey long tongues of flame shot from the windows of the library She watched the smoke rise into the sky and thought sadly of all the books the Starks had gathered over the centuries Then she closed the shutters

When she turned away from the window the man was in the room with her

You weren’t s’posed to be here he muttered sourly No one was s’posed to be here

He was a small dirty man in filthy brown clothing and he stank of horses Catelyn knew all the men who worked in their stables and he was none of them He was gaunt with limp blond hair and pale eyes deep-sunk in a bony face and there was a dagger in his hand

Catelyn looked at the knife then at Bran No she said The word stuck in her throat the merest whisper

He must have heard her It’s a mercy he said He’s dead already

No Catelyn said louder now as she found her voice again No you can’t She spun back toward the window to scream for help but the man moved faster than she would have believed One hand clamped down over her mouth and yanked back her head the other brought the dagger up to her windpipe The stench of him was overwhelming

She reached up with both hands and grabbed the blade with all her strength pulling it away from her throat She heard him cursing into her ear Her fingers were slippery with blood but she would not let go of the dagger The hand over her mouth clenched more tightly shutting off her air Catelyn twisted her head to the side and managed to get a piece of his flesh between her teeth She bit down hard into his palm The man grunted in pain She ground her teeth together and tore at him and all of a sudden he let go The taste of his blood filled her mouth She sucked in air and screamed and he grabbed her hair and pulled her away from him and she stumbled and went down and then he was standing over her breathing hard shaking The dagger was still clutched tightly in his right hand slick with blood You weren’t s’posed to be here he repeated stupidly

Catelyn saw the shadow slip through the open door behind him There was a low rumble less than a snarl the merest whisper of a threat but he must have heard something because he started to turn just as the wolf made its leap They went down together half sprawled over Catelyn where she’d fallen The wolf had him under the jaw The man’s shriek lasted less than a second before the beast wrenched back its head taking out half his throat

His blood felt like warm rain as it sprayed across her face

The wolf was looking at her Its jaws were red and wet and its eyes glowed golden in the dark room It was Bran’s wolf she realized Of course it was Thank you Catelyn whispered her voice faint and tiny She lifted her hand trembling The wolf padded closer sniffed at her fingers then licked at the blood with a wet rough tongue When it had cleaned all the blood off her hand it turned away silently and jumped up on Bran’s bed and lay down beside him Catelyn began to laugh hysterically

That was the way they found them when Robb and Maester Luwin and Ser Rodrik burst in with half the guards in Winterfell When the laughter finally died in her throat they wrapped her in warm blankets and led her back to the Great Keep to her own chambers Old Nan undressed her and helped her into a scalding hot bath and washed the blood off her with a soft cloth

Afterward Maester Luwin arrived to dress her wounds The cuts in her fingers went deep almost to the bone and her scalp was raw and bleeding where he’d pulled out a handful of hair The maester told her the pain was just starting now and gave her milk of the poppy to help her sleep

Finally she closed her eyes

When she opened them again they told her that she had slept four days Catelyn nodded and sat up in bed It all seemed like a nightmare to her now everything since Bran’s fall a terrible dream of blood and grief but she had the pain in her hands to remind her that it was real She felt weak and light-headed yet strangely resolute as if a great weight had lifted from her

Bring me some bread and honey she told her servants and take word to Maester Luwin that my bandages want changing They looked at her in surprise and ran to do her bidding

Catelyn remembered the way she had been before and she was ashamed She had let them all down her children her husband her House It would not happen again She would show these northerners how strong a Tully of Riverrun could be

Robb arrived before her food Rodrik Cassel came with him and her husband’s ward Theon Greyjoy and lastly Hallis Mollen a muscular guardsman with a square brown beard He was the new captain of the guard Robb said Her son was dressed in boiled leather and ringmail she saw and a sword hung at his waist

Who was he Catelyn asked them

No one knows his name Hallis Mollen told her He was no man of Winterfell m’lady but some says they seen him here and about the castle these past few weeks

One of the king’s men then she said or one of the Lannisters’ He could have waited behind when the others left

Maybe Hal said With all these strangers filling up Winterfell of late there’s no way of saying who he belonged to

He’d been hiding in your stables Greyjoy said You could smell it on him

And how could he go unnoticed she said sharply

Hallis Mollen looked abashed Between the horses Lord Eddard took south and them we sent north to the Night’s Watch the stalls were half-empty It were no great trick to hide from the stableboys Could be Hodor saw him the talk is that boy’s been acting queer but simple as he is… Hal shook his head

We found where he’d been sleeping Robb put in He had ninety silver stags in a leather bag buried beneath the straw

It’s good to know my son’s life was not sold cheaply Catelyn said bitterly
