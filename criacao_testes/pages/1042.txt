Arya could not lie to him She lowered her eyes

Lord Eddard Stark sighed My nine-year-old daughter is being armed from my own forge and I know nothing of it The Hand of the King is expected to rule the Seven Kingdoms yet it seems I cannot even rule my own household How is it that you come to own a sword Arya Where did you get this

Arya chewed her lip and said nothing She would not betray Jon not even to their father

After a while Father said I don’t suppose it matters truly He looked down gravely at the sword in his hands This is no toy for children least of all for a girl What would Septa Mordane say if she knew you were playing with swords

I wasn’t playing Arya insisted I hate Septa Mordane

That’s enough Her father’s voice was curt and hard The septa is doing no more than is her duty though gods know you have made it a struggle for the poor woman Your mother and I have charged her with the impossible task of making you a lady

I don’t want to be a lady Arya flared

I ought to snap this toy across my knee here and now and put an end to this nonsense

Needle wouldn’t break Arya said defiantly but her voice betrayed her words

It has a name does it Her father sighed Ah Arya You have a wildness in you child ‘The wolf blood’ my father used to call it Lyanna had a touch of it and my brother Brandon more than a touch It brought them both to an early grave Arya heard sadness in his voice he did not often speak of his father or of the brother and sister who had died before she was born Lyanna might have carried a sword if my lord father had allowed it You remind me of her sometimes You even look like her

Lyanna was beautiful Arya said startled Everybody said so It was not a thing that was ever said of Arya

She was Eddard Stark agreed beautiful and willful and dead before her time He lifted the sword held it out between them Arya what did you think to do with this… Needle Who did you hope to skewer Your sister Septa Mordane Do you know the first thing about sword fighting

All she could think of was the lesson Jon had given her Stick them with the pointy end she blurted out

Her father snorted back laughter That is the essence of it I suppose

Arya desperately wanted to explain to make him see I was trying to learn but… Her eyes filled with tears I asked Mycah to practice with me The grief came on her all at once She turned away shaking I asked him she cried It was my fault it was me…

Suddenly her father’s arms were around her He held her gently as she turned to him and sobbed against his chest No sweet one he murmured Grieve for your friend but never blame yourself You did not kill the butcher’s boy That murder lies at the Hound’s door him and the cruel woman he serves

I hate them Arya confided red-faced sniffling The Hound and the queen and the king and Prince Joffrey I hate all of them Joffrey lied it wasn’t the way he said I hate Sansa too She did remember she just lied so Joffrey would like her

We all lie her father said Or did you truly think I’d believe that Nymeria ran off

Arya blushed guiltily Jory promised not to tell

Jory kept his word her father said with a smile There are some things I do not need to be told Even a blind man could see that wolf would never have left you willingly

We had to throw rocks she said miserably I told her to run to go be free that I didn’t want her anymore There were other wolves for her to play with we heard them howling and Jory said the woods were full of game so she’d have deer to hunt Only she kept following and finally we had to throw rocks I hit her twice She whined and looked at me and I felt so ’shamed but it was right wasn’t it The queen would have killed her

It was right her father said And even the lie was… not without honor He’d put Needle aside when he went to Arya to embrace her Now he took the blade up again and walked to the window where he stood for a moment looking out across the courtyard When he turned back his eyes were thoughtful He seated himself on the window seat Needle across his lap Arya sit down I need to try and explain some things to you

She perched anxiously on the edge of her bed You are too young to be burdened with all my cares he told her but you are also a Stark of Winterfell You know our words

Winter is coming Arya whispered

The hard cruel times her father said We tasted them on the Trident child and when Bran fell You were born in the long summer sweet one you’ve never known anything else but now the winter is truly coming Remember the sigil of our House Arya

The direwolf she said thinking of Nymeria She hugged her knees against her chest suddenly afraid

Let me tell you something about wolves child When the snows fall and the white winds blow the lone wolf dies but the pack survives Summer is the time for squabbles In winter we must protect one another keep each other warm share our strengths So if you must hate Arya hate those who would truly do us harm Septa Mordane is a good woman and Sansa… Sansa is your sister You may be as different as the sun and the moon but the same blood flows through both your hearts You need her as she needs you… and I need both of you gods help me

He sounded so tired that it made Arya sad I don’t hate Sansa she told him Not truly It was only half a lie

I do not mean to frighten you but neither will I lie to you We have come to a dark dangerous place child This is not Winterfell We have enemies who mean us ill We cannot fight a war among ourselves This willfulness of yours the running off the angry words the disobedience… at home these were only the summer games of a child Here and now with winter soon upon us that is a different matter It is time to begin growing up

I will Arya vowed She had never loved him so much as she did in that instant I can be strong too I can be as strong as Robb

He held Needle out to her hilt first Here

She looked at the sword with wonder in her eyes For a moment she was afraid to touch it afraid that if she reached for it it would be snatched away again but then her father said Go on it’s yours and she took it in her hand

I can keep it she said For true

For true He smiled If I took it away no doubt I’d find a morningstar hidden under your pillow within the fortnight Try not to stab your sister whatever the provocation

I won’t I promise Arya clutched Needle tightly to her chest as her father took his leave

The next morning as they broke their fast she apologized to Septa Mordane and asked for her pardon The septa peered at her suspiciously but Father nodded

Three days later at midday her father’s steward Vayon Poole sent Arya to the Small Hall The trestle tables had been dismantled and the benches shoved against the walls The hall seemed empty until an unfamiliar voice said You are late boy A slight man with a bald head and a great beak of a nose stepped out of the shadows holding a pair of slender wooden swords Tomorrow you will be here at midday He had an accent the lilt of the Free Cities Braavos perhaps or Myr

Who are you Arya asked

I am your dancing master He tossed her one of the wooden blades She grabbed for it missed and heard it clatter to the floor Tomorrow you will catch it Now pick it up

It was not just a stick but a true wooden sword complete with grip and guard and pommel Arya picked it up and clutched it nervously with both hands holding it out in front of her It was heavier than it looked much heavier than Needle

The bald man clicked his teeth together That is not the way boy This is not a greatsword that is needing two hands to swing it You will take the blade in one hand

It’s too heavy Arya said

It is heavy as it needs to be to make you strong and for the balancing A hollow inside is filled with lead just so One hand now is all that is needing

Arya took her right hand off the grip and wiped her sweaty palm on her pants She held the sword in her left hand He seemed to approve The left is good All is reversed it will make your enemies more awkward Now you are standing wrong Turn your body sideface yes so You are skinny as the shaft of a spear do you know That is good too the target is smaller Now the grip Let me see He moved closer and peered at her hand prying her fingers apart rearranging them Just so yes Do not squeeze it so tight no the grip must be deft delicate

What if I drop it Arya said

The steel must be part of your arm the bald man told her Can you drop part of your arm No Nine years Syrio Forel was first sword to the Sealord of Braavos he knows these things Listen to him boy

It was the third time he had called her boy I’m a girl Arya objected

Boy girl Syrio Forel said You are a sword that is all He clicked his teeth together Just so that is the grip You are not holding a battle-axe you are holding a—

—needle Arya finished for him fiercely

Just so Now we will begin the dance Remember child this is not the iron dance of Westeros we are learning the knight’s dance hacking and hammering no This is the bravo’s dance the water dance swift and sudden All men are made of water do you know this When you pierce them the water leaks out and they die He took a step backward raised his own wooden blade Now you will try to strike me
