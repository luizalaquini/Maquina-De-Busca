It makes no matter Catelyn said He is more dead than alive yet more alive than my poor sweet sons

My lady is there aught I might do for you A sleeping draught perhaps

Thank you Maester but no I will not sleep away my grief Bran and Rickon deserve better from me Go and join the celebration I will sit with my father for a time

As you will my lady Vyman bowed and left her

Lord Hoster lay on his back mouth open his breath a faint whistling sigh One hand hung over the edge of the mattress a pale frail fleshless thing but warm when she touched it She slid her fingers through his and closed them No matter how tightly I hold him I cannot keep him here she thought sadly Let him go Yet her fingers would not seem to unbend

I have no one to talk with Father she told him I pray but the gods do not answer Lightly she kissed his hand The skin was warm blue veins branching like rivers beneath his pale translucent skin Outside the greater rivers flowed the Red Fork and the Tumblestone and they would flow forever but not so the rivers in her father’s hand Too soon that current would grow still Last night I dreamed of that time Lysa and I got lost while riding back from Seagard Do you remember That strange fog came up and we fell behind the rest of the party Everything was grey and I could not see a foot past the nose of my horse We lost the road The branches of the trees were like long skinny arms reaching out to grab us as we passed Lysa started to cry and when I shouted the fog seemed to swallow the sound But Petyr knew where we were and he rode back and found us   

But there’s no one to find me now is there This time I have to find our own way and it is hard so hard

I keep remembering the Stark words Winter has come Father For me For me Robb must fight the Greyjoys now as well as the Lannisters and for what For a gold hat and an iron chair Surely the land has bled enough I want my girls back I want Robb to lay down his sword and pick some homely daughter of Walder Frey to make him happy and give him sons I want Bran and Rickon back I want    Catelyn hung her head I want she said once more and then her words were gone

After a time the candle guttered and went out Moonlight slanted between the slats of the shutters laying pale silvery bars across her father’s face She could hear the soft whisper of his labored breathing the endless rush of waters the faint chords of some love song drifting up from the yard so sad and sweet I loved a maid as red as autumn Rymund sang with sunset in her hair

Catelyn never noticed when the singing ended Hours had passed yet it seemed only a heartbeat before Brienne was at the door My lady she announced softly Midnight has come

Midnight has come Father she thought and I must do my duty She let go of his hand

The gaoler was a furtive little man with broken veins in his nose They found him bent over a tankard of ale and the remains of a pigeon pie more than a little drunk He squinted at them suspiciously Begging your forgiveness m’lady but Lord Edmure says no one is to see the Kingslayer without a writing from him with his seal upon it

Lord Edmure Has my father died and no one told me

The gaoler licked his lips No m’lady not as I knows

You will open the cell or you will come with me to Lord Hoster’s solar and tell him why you saw fit to defy me

His eyes fell As m’lady says The keys were chained to the studded leather belt that girdled his waist He muttered under his breath as he sorted through them until he found the one that fit the door to the Kingslayer’s cell

Go back to your ale and leave us she commanded An oil lamp hung from a hook on the low ceiling Catelyn took it down and turned up the flame Brienne see that I am not disturbed

Nodding Brienne took up a position just outside the cell her hand resting on the pommel of her sword My lady will call if she has need of me

Catelyn shouldered aside the heavy wood-and-iron door and stepped into foul darkness This was the bowels of Riverrun and smelled the part Old straw crackled underfoot The walls were discolored with patches of nitre Through the stone she could hear the faint rush of the Tumblestone The lamplight revealed a pail overflowing with feces in one corner and a huddled shape in another The flagon of wine stood beside the door untouched So much for that ploy I ought to be thankful that the gaoler did not drink it himself I suppose

Jaime raised his hands to cover his face the chains around his wrists clanking Lady Stark he said in a voice hoarse with disuse I fear I am in no condition to receive you

Look at me ser

The light hurts my eyes A moment if you would Jaime Lannister had been allowed no razor since the night he was taken in the Whispering Wood and a shaggy beard covered his face once so like the queen’s Glinting gold in the lamplight the whiskers made him look like some great yellow beast magnificent even in chains His unwashed hair fell to his shoulders in ropes and tangles the clothes were rotting on his body his face was pale and wasted    and even so the power and the beauty of the man were still apparent

I see you had no taste for the wine I sent you

Such sudden generosity seemed somewhat suspect

I can have your head off anytime I want Why would I need to poison you

Death by poison can seem natural Harder to claim that my head simply fell off He squinted up from the floor his cat-green eyes slowly becoming accustomed to the light I’d invite you to sit but your brother has neglected to provide me a chair

I can stand well enough

Can you You look terrible I must say Though perhaps it’s just the light in here He was fettered at wrist and ankle each cuff chained to the others so he could neither stand nor lie comfortably The ankle chains were bolted to the wall Are my bracelets heavy enough for you or did you come to add a few more I’ll rattle them prettily if you like

You brought this on yourself she reminded him We granted you the comfort of a tower cell befitting your birth and station You repaid us by trying to escape

A cell is a cell Some under Casterly Rock make this one seem a sunlit garden One day perhaps I’ll show them to you

If he is cowed he hides it well Catelyn thought A man chained hand and foot should keep a more courteous tongue in his mouth ser I did not come here to be threatened

No Then surely it was to have your pleasure of me It’s said that widows grow weary of their empty beds We of the Kingsguard vow never to wed but I suppose I could still service you if that’s what you need Pour us some of that wine and slip out of that gown and we’ll see if I’m up to it

Catelyn stared down at him in revulsion Was there ever a man as beautiful or as vile as this one If you said that in my son’s hearing he would kill you for it

Only so long as I was wearing these Jaime Lannister rattled his chains at her We both know the boy is afraid to face me in single combat

My son may be young but if you take him for a fool you are sadly mistaken    and it seems to me that you were not so quick to make challenges when you had an army at your back

Did the old Kings of Winter hide behind their mothers’ skirts as well

I grow weary of this ser There are things I must know

Why should I tell you anything

To save your life

You think I fear death That seemed to amuse him

You should Your crimes will have earned you a place of torment in the deepest of the seven hells if the gods are just

What gods are those Lady Catelyn The trees your husband prayed to How well did they serve him when my sister took his head off Jaime gave a chuckle If there are gods why is the world so full of pain and injustice

Because of men like you

There are no men like me There’s only me

There is nothing here but arrogance and pride and the empty courage of a madman I am wasting my breath with this one If there was ever a spark of honor in him it is long dead If you will not speak with me so be it Drink the wine or piss in it ser it makes no matter to me

Her hand was at the door pull when he said Lady Stark She turned waited Things go to rust in this damp Jaime went on Even a man’s courtesies Stay and you shall have your answers    for a price

He has no shame Captives do not set prices

Oh you’ll find mine modest enough Your turnkey tells me nothing but vile lies and he cannot even keep them straight One day he says Cersei has been flayed and the next it’s my father Answer my questions and I’ll answer yours

Truthfully

Oh it’s truth you want Be careful my lady Tyrion says that people often claim to hunger for truth but seldom like the taste when it’s served up
