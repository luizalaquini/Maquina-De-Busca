The Dornishman’s wife was as fair as the sun

and her kisses were warmer than spring

But the Dornishman’s blade was made of black steel

and its kiss was a terrible thing





Jon knew the song though it was strange to hear it here in a shaggy hide tent beyond the Wall ten thousand leagues from the red mountains and warm winds of Dorne

Rattleshirt took off his yellowed helm as he waited for the song to end Beneath his bone-and-leather armor he was a small man and the face under the giant’s skull was ordinary with a knobby chin thin mustache and sallow pinched cheeks His eyes were close-set one eyebrow creeping all the way across his forehead dark hair thinning back from a sharp widow’s peak





The Dornishman’s wife would sing as she bathed

in a voice that was sweet as a peach

But the Dornishman’s blade had a song of its own

and a bite sharp and cold as a leech





Beside the brazier a short but immensely broad man sat on a stool eating a hen off a skewer Hot grease was running down his chin and into his snow-white beard but he smiled happily all the same Thick gold bands graven with runes bound his massive arms and he wore a heavy shirt of black ringmail that could only have come from a dead ranger A few feet away a taller leaner man in a leather shirt sewn with bronze scales stood frowning over a map a two-handed greatsword slung across his back in a leather sheath He was straight as a spear all long wiry muscle clean-shaved bald with a strong straight nose and deepset grey eyes He might even have been comely if he’d had ears but he had lost both along the way whether to frostbite or some enemy’s knife Jon could not tell Their lack made the man’s head seem narrow and pointed

Both the white-bearded man and the bald one were warriors that was plain to Jon at a glance These two are more dangerous than Rattleshirt by far He wondered which was Mance Rayder





As he lay on the ground with the darkness around

and the taste of his blood on his tongue

His brothers knelt by him and prayed him a prayer

and he smiled and he laughed and he sung

Brothers oh brothers my days here are done

the Dornishman’s taken my life

But what does it matter for all men must die

and I’ve tasted the Dornishman’s wife





As the last strains of The Dornishman’s Wife faded the bald earless man glanced up from his map and scowled ferociously at Rattleshirt and Ygritte with Jon between them What’s this he said A crow

The black bastard what gutted Orell said Rattleshirt and a bloody warg as well

You were to kill them all

This one come over explained Ygritte He slew Qhorin Halfhand with his own hand

This boy The earless man was angered by the news The Halfhand should have been mine Do you have a name crow

Jon Snow Your Grace He wondered whether he was expected to bend the knee as well

Your Grace The earless man looked at the big white-bearded one You see He takes me for a king

The bearded man laughed so hard he sprayed bits of chicken everywhere He rubbed the grease from his mouth with the back of a huge hand A blind boy must be Who ever heard of a king without ears Why his crown would fall straight down to his neck Har He grinned at Jon wiping his fingers clean on his breeches Close your beak crow Spin yourself around might be you’d find who you’re looking for

Jon turned

The singer rose to his feet I’m Mance Rayder he said as he put aside the lute And you are Ned Stark’s bastard the Snow of Winterfell 

Stunned Jon stood speechless for a moment before he recovered enough to say How… how could you know…

That’s a tale for later said Mance Rayder How did you like the song lad

Well enough I’d heard it before

But what does it matter for all men must die the King-beyond-the-Wall said lightly and I’ve tasted the Dornishman’s wife Tell me does my Lord of Bones speak truly Did you slay my old friend the Halffiand

I did Though it was his doing more than mine

The Shadow Tower will never again seem as fearsome the king said with sadness in his voice Qhorin was my enemy But also my brother once So… shall I thank you for killing him Jon Snow Or curse you He gave Jon a mocking smile

The King-beyond-the-Wall looked nothing like a king nor even much a wildling He was of middling height slender sharp-faced with shrewd brown eyes and long brown hair that had gone mostly to grey There was no crown on his head no gold rings on his arms no jewels at his throat not even a gleam of silver He wore wool and leather and his only garment of note was his ragged black wool cloak its long tears patched with faded red silk

You ought to thank me for killing your enemy Jon said finally and curse me for killing your friend

Har boomed the white-bearded man Well answered
