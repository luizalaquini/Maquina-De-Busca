I lifted up mine eyes and saw in a dream and behold the rams which
leaped upon the cattle were ringstraked speckled and grisled

3111 And the angel of God spake unto me in a dream saying Jacob
And I said Here am I

3112 And he said Lift up now thine eyes and see all the rams which
leap upon the cattle are ringstraked speckled and grisled for I
have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee

3113 I am the God of Bethel where thou anointedst the pillar and
where thou vowedst a vow unto me now arise get thee out from this
land and return unto the land of thy kindred

3114 And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him Is there yet any
portion or inheritance for us in our fathers house  3115 Are we not
counted of him strangers for he hath sold us and hath quite devoured
also our money

3116 For all the riches which God hath taken from our father that is
ours and our childrens now then whatsoever God hath said unto
thee do

3117 Then Jacob rose up and set his sons and his wives upon camels
3118 And he carried away all his cattle and all his goods which he
had gotten the cattle of his getting which he had gotten in
Padanaram for to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan

3119 And Laban went to shear his sheep and Rachel had stolen the
images that were her fathers

3120 And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian in that he
told him not that he fled

3121 So he fled with all that he had and he rose up and passed over
the river and set his face toward the mount Gilead

3122 And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled

3123 And he took his brethren with him and pursued after him seven
days journey and they overtook him in the mount Gilead

3124 And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night and said
unto him Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad

3125 Then Laban overtook Jacob Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the
mount and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of Gilead

3126 And Laban said to Jacob What hast thou done that thou hast
stolen away unawares to me and carried away my daughters as captives
taken with the sword  3127 Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly
and steal away from me and didst not tell me that I might have sent
thee away with mirth and with songs with tabret and with harp
3128 And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters thou
hast now done foolishly in so doing

3129 It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt but the God of
your father spake unto me yesternight saying Take thou heed that
thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad

3130 And now though thou wouldest needs be gone because thou sore
longedst after thy fathers house yet wherefore hast thou stolen my
gods  3131 And Jacob answered and said to Laban Because I was
afraid for I said Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy
daughters from me

3132 With whomsoever thou findest thy gods let him not live before
our brethren discern thou what is thine with me and take it to thee
For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them

3133 And Laban went into Jacobs tent and into Leahs tent and into
the two maidservants tents but he found them not Then went he out
of Leahs tent and entered into Rachels tent

3134 Now Rachel had taken the images and put them in the camels
furniture and sat upon them And Laban searched all the tent but
found them not

3135 And she said to her father Let it not displease my lord that I
cannot rise up before thee for the custom of women is upon me And he
searched but found not the images

3136 And Jacob was wroth and chode with Laban and Jacob answered
and said to Laban What is my trespass what is my sin that thou hast
so hotly pursued after me  3137 Whereas thou hast searched all my
stuff what hast thou found of all thy household stuff set it here
before my brethren and thy brethren that they may judge betwixt us
both

3138 This twenty years have I been with thee thy ewes and thy she
goats have not cast their young and the rams of thy flock have I not
eaten

3139 That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee I bare
the loss of it of my hand didst thou require it whether stolen by
day or stolen by night

3140 Thus I was in the day the drought consumed me and the frost by
night and my sleep departed from mine eyes
