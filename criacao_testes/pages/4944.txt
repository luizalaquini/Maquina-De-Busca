trees of lign aloes which the LORD hath planted and as cedar trees
beside the waters

247 He shall pour the water out of his buckets and his seed shall be
in many waters and his king shall be higher than Agag and his
kingdom shall be exalted

248 God brought him forth out of Egypt he hath as it were the
strength of an unicorn he shall eat up the nations his enemies and
shall break their bones and pierce them through with his arrows

249 He couched he lay down as a lion and as a great lion who shall
stir him up Blessed is he that blesseth thee and cursed is he that
curseth thee

2410 And Balaks anger was kindled against Balaam and he smote his
hands together and Balak said unto Balaam I called thee to curse
mine enemies and behold thou hast altogether blessed them these
three times

2411 Therefore now flee thou to thy place I thought to promote thee
unto great honour but lo the LORD hath kept thee back from honour

2412 And Balaam said unto Balak Spake I not also to thy messengers
which thou sentest unto me saying 2413 If Balak would give me his
house full of silver and gold I cannot go beyond the commandment of
the LORD to do either good or bad of mine own mind but what the LORD
saith that will I speak  2414 And now behold I go unto my people
come therefore and I will advertise thee what this people shall do to
thy people in the latter days

2415 And he took up his parable and said Balaam the son of Beor
hath said and the man whose eyes are open hath said 2416 He hath
said which heard the words of God and knew the knowledge of the most
High which saw the vision of the Almighty falling into a trance but
having his eyes open 2417 I shall see him but not now I shall
behold him but not nigh there shall come a Star out of Jacob and a
Sceptre shall rise out of Israel and shall smite the corners of Moab
and destroy all the children of Sheth

2418 And Edom shall be a possession Seir also shall be a possession
for his enemies and Israel shall do valiantly

2419 Out of Jacob shall come he that shall have dominion and shall
destroy him that remaineth of the city

2420 And when he looked on Amalek he took up his parable and said
Amalek was the first of the nations but his latter end shall be that
he perish for ever

2421 And he looked on the Kenites and took up his parable and said
Strong is thy dwellingplace and thou puttest thy nest in a rock

2422 Nevertheless the Kenite shall be wasted until Asshur shall
carry thee away captive

2423 And he took up his parable and said Alas who shall live when
God doeth this  2424 And ships shall come from the coast of Chittim
and shall afflict Asshur and shall afflict Eber and he also shall
perish for ever

2425 And Balaam rose up and went and returned to his place and
Balak also went his way

251 And Israel abode in Shittim and the people began to commit
whoredom with the daughters of Moab

252 And they called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods and
the people did eat and bowed down to their gods

253 And Israel joined himself unto Baalpeor and the anger of the
LORD was kindled against Israel

254 And the LORD said unto Moses Take all the heads of the people
and hang them up before the LORD against the sun that the fierce
anger of the LORD may be turned away from Israel

255 And Moses said unto the judges of Israel Slay ye every one his
men that were joined unto Baalpeor

256 And behold one of the children of Israel came and brought unto
his brethren a Midianitish woman in the sight of Moses and in the
sight of all the congregation of the children of Israel who were
weeping before the door of the tabernacle of the congregation

257 And when Phinehas the son of Eleazar the son of Aaron the
priest saw it he rose up from among the congregation and took a
javelin in his hand 258 And he went after the man of Israel into the
tent and thrust both of them through the man of Israel and the
woman through her belly So the plague was stayed from the children of
Israel

259 And those that died in the plague were twenty and four thousand

2510 And the LORD spake unto Moses saying 2511 Phinehas the son
of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest hath turned my wrath away
from the children of Israel while he was zealous for my sake among
them that I consumed not the children of Israel in my jealousy

2512 Wherefore say Behold I give unto him my covenant of peace
