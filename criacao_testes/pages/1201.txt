A most hmmm loving gesture my lord Perhaps instead some few of us might call upon the king at the Red Keep A small demonstration of our powers as it were to distract His Grace from his many cares for an evening Wildfire is but one of the dread secrets of our ancient order Many and wondrous are the things we might show you

I will take it up with my sister Tyrion had no objection to a few magic tricks but Joff’s fondness for making men fight to the death was trial enough he had no intention of allowing the boy to taste the possibilities of burning them alive

When at last they reached the top of the steps Tyrion shrugged out of his shadowskin fur and folded it over his arm The Guildhall of the Alchemists was an imposing warren of black stone but Hallyne led him through the twists and turns until they reached the Gallery of the Iron Torches a long echoing chamber where columns of green fire danced around black metal columns twenty feet tall Ghostly flames shimmered off the polished black marble of the walls and floor and bathed the hall in an emerald radiance Tyrion would have been more impressed if he hadn’t known that the great iron torches had only been lit this morning in honor of his visit and would be extinguished the instant the doors closed behind him Wildfire was too costly to squander

They emerged atop the broad curving steps that fronted on the Street of the Sisters near the foot of Visenya’s Hill He bid Hallyne farewell and waddled down to where Timett son of Timett waited with an escort of Burned Men Given his purpose today it had seemed a singularly appropriate choice for his guard Besides their scars struck terror in the hearts of the city rabble That was all to the good these days Only three nights past another mob had gathered at the gates of the Red Keep chanting for food Joff had unleashed a storm of arrows against them slaying four and then shouted down that they had his leave to eat their dead Winning us still more friends

Tyrion was surprised to see Bronn standing beside the litter as well What are you doing here

Delivering your messages Bronn said Ironhand wants you urgently at the Gate of the Gods He won’t say why And you’ve been summoned to Maegor’s too

Summoned Tyrion knew of only one person who would presume to use that word And what does Cersei want of me

Bronn shrugged The queen commands you to return to the castle at once and attend her in her chambers That stripling cousin of yours delivered the message Four hairs on his lip and he thinks he’s a man

Four hairs and a knighthood He’s Ser Lancel now never forget Tyrion knew that Ser Jacelyn would not send for him unless the matter was of import I’d best see what Bywater wants Inform my sister that I will attend her on my return

She won’t like that Bronn warned

Good The longer Cersei waits the angrier she’ll become and anger makes her stupid I much prefer angry and stupid to composed and cunning Tyrion tossed his folded cloak into his litter and Timett helped him up after it

The market square inside the Gate of the Gods which in normal times would have been thronged with farmers selling vegetables was near deserted when Tyrion crossed it Ser Jacelyn met him at the gate and raised his iron hand in brusque salute My lord Your cousin Cleos Frey is here come from Riverrun under a peace banner with a letter from Robb Stark

Peace terms

So he says

Sweet cousin Show me to him

The gold cloaks had confined Ser Cleos to a windowless guardroom in the gatehouse He rose when they entered Tyrion you are a most welcome sight

That’s not something I hear often cousin

Has Cersei come with you

My sister is otherwise occupied Is this Stark’s letter He plucked it off the table Ser Jacelyn you may leave us

Bywater bowed and departed I was asked to bring the offer to the Queen Regent Ser Cleos said as the door shut

I shall Tyrion glanced over the map that Robb Stark had sent with his letter All in good time cousin Sit Rest You look gaunt and haggard He looked worse than that in truth

Yes Ser Cleos lowered himself onto a bench It is bad in the riverlands Tyrion Around the Gods Eye and along the kingsroad especially The river lords are burning their own crops to try and starve us and your father’s foragers are torching every village they take and putting the smallfolk to the sword

That was the way of war The smallfolk were slaughtered while the highborn were held for ransom Remind me to thank the gods that I was bom a Lannister

Ser Cleos ran a hand through his thin brown hair Even with a peace banner we were attacked twice Wolves in mail hungry to savage anyone weaker than themselves The gods alone know what side they started on but they’re on their own side now Lost three men and twice as many wounded

What news of our foe Tyrion turned his attention back to Stark’s terms The boy does not want too much Only half the realm the release of our captives hostages his father’s sword… oh yes and his sisters

The boy sits idle at Riverrun Ser Cleos said I think he fears to face your father in the field His strength grows less each day The river lords have departed each to defend his own lands

Is this what Father intended Tyrion rolled up Stark’s map These terms will never do

Will you at least consent to trade the Stark girls for Tion and Willem Ser Cleos asked plaintively

Tion Frey was his younger brother Tyrion recalled No he said gently but we’ll propose our own exchange of captives Let me consult with Cersei and the council We shall send you back to Riverrun with our terms

Clearly the prospect did not cheer him My lord I do not believe Robb Stark will yield easily It is Lady Catelyn who wants this peace not the boy

Lady Catelyn wants her daughters Tyrion pushed himself down from the bench letter and map in hand Ser Jacelyn will see that you have food and fire You look in dire need of sleep cousin I will send for you when we know more

He found Ser Jacelyn on the ramparts watching several hundred new recruits drilling in the field below With so many seeking refuge in King’s Landing there was no lack of men willing to join the City Watch for a full belly and a bed of straw in the barracks but Tyrion had no illusions about how well these ragged defenders of theirs would fight if it came to battle

You did well to send for me Tyrion said I shall leave Ser Cleos in your hands He is to have every hospitality

And his escort the commander wanted to know

Give them food and clean garb and find a maester to see to their hurts They are not to set foot inside the city is that understood It would never do to have the truth of conditions in King’s Landing reach Robb Stark in Riverrun

Well understood my lord

Oh and one more thing The alchemists will be sending a large supply of clay pots to each of the city gates You’re to use them to train the men who will work your spitfires Fill the pots with green paint and have them drill at loading and firing Any man who spatters should be replaced When they have mastered the paint pots substitute lamp oil and have them work at lighting the jars and firing them while aflame Once they learn to do that without burning themselves they may be ready for wildfire

Ser Jacelyn scratched at his cheek with his iron hand Wise measures Though I have no love for that alchemist’s piss

Nor I but I use what I’m given

Once back inside his litter Tyrion Lannister drew the curtains and plumped a cushion under his elbow Cersei would be displeased to learn that he had intercepted Stark’s letter but his father had sent him here to rule not to please Cersei

It seemed to him that Robb Stark had given them a golden chance Let the boy wait at Riverrun dreaming of an easy peace Tyrion would reply with terms of his own giving the King in the North just enough of what he wanted to keep him hopeful Let Ser Cleos wear out his bony Frey rump riding to and fro with offers and counters All the while their cousin Ser Stafford would be training and arming the new host he’d raised at Casterly Rock Once he was ready he and Lord Tywin could smash the Tullys and Starks between them

Now if only Robert’s brothers would be so accommodating Glacial as his progress was still Renly Baratheon crept north and east with his huge southron host and scarcely a night passed that Tyrion did not dread being awakened with the news that Lord Stannis was sailing his fleet up the Blackwater Rush Well it would seem I have a goodly stock of wildfire but still…

The sound of some hubbub in the street intruded on his worries Tyrion peered out cautiously between the curtains They were passing through Cobbler’s Square where a sizable crowd had gathered beneath the leather awnings to listen to the rantings of a prophet A robe of undyed wool belted with a hempen rope marked him for one of the begging brothers

Corruption the man cried shrilly There is the warning Behold the Father’s scourge He pointed at the fuzzy red wound in the sky From this vantage the distant castle on Aegon’s High Hill was directly behind him with the comet hanging forebodingly over its towers A clever choice of stage Tyrion reflected We have become swollen bloated foul Brother couples with sister in the bed of kings and the fruit of their incest capers in his palace to the piping of a twisted little monkey demon Highborn ladies fornicate with fools and give birth to monsters Even the High Septon has forgotten the gods He bathes in scented waters and grows fat on lark and lamprey while his people starve Pride comes before prayer maggots rule our castles and gold is all… but no more The Rotten Summer is at an end and the Whoremonger King is brought low When the boar did open him a great stench rose to heaven and a thousand snakes slid forth from his belly hissing and biting He jabbed his bony finger back at comet and castle There comes the Harbinger Cleanse yourselves the gods cry out lest ye be cleansed Bathe in the wine of righteousness or you shall be bathed in fire Fire

Fire other voices echoed but the hoots of derision almost drowned them out Tyrion took solace from that He gave the command to continue and the litter rocked like a ship on a rough sea as the Burned Men cleared a path Twisted little monkey demon indeed The wretch did have a point about the High Septon to be sure What was it that Moon Boy had said of him the other day A pious man who worships the Seven so fervently that he eats a meal for each of them whenever he sits to table The memory of the fool’s jape made Tyrion smile

He was pleased to reach the Red Keep without further incident As he climbed the steps to his chambers Tyrion felt a deal more hopeful than he had at dawn Time that’s all I truly need time to piece it all together Once the chain is done… He opened the door to his solar

Cersei turned away from the window her skirts swirling around her slender hips How dare you ignore my summons

Who admitted you to my tower

Your tower This is my son’s royal castle

So they tell me Tyrion was not amused Crawn would be even less so his Moon Brothers had the guard today I was about to come to you as it happens
